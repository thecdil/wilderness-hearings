My name is Dave Suhr, and I am presenting this testimony on behalf of Mr. Stan Huff who has been a resident of Idaho  all his life, and has practiced as a professional geologist for Asarco  for nearly 28 years.  We, as many others, wish to see the RARE II process end, and  certainly do not want a RARE III.  We are all advocates of wilderness to some degree; but, first and  foremost, we must live in the real world where we are entirely dependent on the basic industries. Realization of this is the key to a  rational solution to the wilderness-development standoff.  We recognize the need for wilderness and the need for land to be  available for multiple use, but the piecemeal allocation of public  lands to virtually nonuse status is completely unacceptable.  Our record of stewardship in Idaho&#39;s public lands shows that our  piecemeal allocations began in 1931 by the setting aside the Idaho  In 1964, the Wilderness Act included 989,000 acres in the  Welway-Bitterrot Wilderness and designated a study for &#39;wilderness suitability&#39; the Idaho Primitive Area of 1.2 million acres, the  Salmon River Breaks Area of 217,000 acres, and the 200,000 acres  of the Sawtooth Primitive Area. The Sawtooth was later included     in the wilderness list.  In 1968, the Middle Fork of the Salmon River was designated a  Wild River.  In 1974, the Sawtooth Wilderness Area was included in the new  754,000-acre Sawtooth National Recreational Area, and was purposely enlarged to include an ASARCO mineral deposit.  In 1975, the forming of the Hells Canyon Wilderness and Recreation Area comprised 350,000 acres.  In 1977, 206,000 acres were placed in the Gospel Hump Wilderness.  In 1978, the St. Joe River was designated a Wild and Scenic  River.  In 1979, we added to the list the River of No Return Wilderness,  125 miles and Wild and Scenic River and the Magruder Corridor  consisting of 2,305,000 acres.  We may put an end to RARE II and not have a RARE III, but  the piecemeal process will continue.  Judging from our past track record and the fact that current  laws, rules, and regulations protect the public lands, we have to  recommendâ€”no more wilderness.

I wish to thank Senator McClure for this opportunity to present my views before the Senate Energy and National Resources Committee hearing.  I will confine my testimony to the Mallard-Larkins Pioneer area.  I have hunted, fished, hiked, and backpacked in this area since  1945. First witb my father and now with my son and nephew.  The Mallard-Larkins area has many unique qualities. It has an  extensive trail system and contains many beautiful mountain lakes  and clear running streams with excellent fishing. It is also the  backbone of both the Clearwater and St. Joe elk and deer herds as  the animals migrate from this area into adjacent areas. There are  many rocky peaks and bluffs that support one of the finest goat  herds in Idaho.  The ridges and draws in most of the Mallard-Larkins area contain many small, swampy areas and fern beds that are ideal as  calfing grounds and fall mating grounds for the elk herds. The soil  is very fragile in a large percentage of the Mallard-Larkin area.  The bulldozing and logging of this area would be very detrimental  as it would dry up most of the small, swampy areas thus killing out  the fern beds thereby severely impacting the wildlife by destroying  the calfing and fall mating grounds.     Any roads downhill from the ridges would cause excessive silting  of the streams and lakes due to the nature of the soils which are of  a very fine consistency therefore reducing the fisheries because of  the silting of the spawning beds in the streams.  I therefore recommend the Mallard-Larkin Pioneer area, approximately 200,000 acres, be included in the wilderness system including the areas from Beaver Creek to Bad Bear Peak, Junction  Point to Bathtub Mountain, Pineapple Peak across to Forage  Mountain down to Adair Creek then to the Gold Center Road to  Jug Camp on the Goat Mountain thence to Crescendo Peak to Getaway Point and then to the North Fork of the Clearwater River.  You would think that something could be worked out between  locking areas up in wilderness and developing an area&#39;s resources  with recklessness than leaving it, could be found. However, having  seen the future plans of the U.S. Forest Service for this area after  the RARE II studies and the lack of concern for wildlife and wildlife habitat, the penchant for clear cutting and excessive roading  with the stated object of putting in enough roads so this area would  never be considered for any type of wilderness at any time in the  future there is no choice but to consider this area be recommended  to be included into the Idaho wilderness system.  The language of any bill considered by this committee should be  as such that possibly various areas could be considered and possibly added to the wilderness system in the future.  Thank you.","Thank you very much. Mr. Schnider.

I&#39;m personally familiar with a fair amount of the  central and southern Idaho RARE II areas. I come to you, Senator McClure, Members of the Senate commit tee, and to the Congress with this plea: Don&#39;t classify as wilderness every high mountain lake, every smooth or rocky ridge, every meadow, every waterfall. Trailbike recreationists appreciate these treasures too. After all, I go to the national forests on my motorcy cle for a different form of the exact same experience the hiker     does.  Let&#39;s together find a way to carefully use and enjoy our national forests while protecting and enhancing their lasting values. There are alternatives to wilderness. A case in point: We have in the White Clouds under the Saw tooth National Recreation area what I call neowilderness. I prefer it because it protects the resource while allowing means to partici pate in recreation. There are several advantages to not designating additional wil derness within the SNRA. For example, a neowilderness bench mark; just as wilderness is purported to provide a bench mark, the White Clouds could serve as a neowilderness bench mark. And then one final comment: If it&#39;s not broke, don&#39;t fix it. Con gress frequently gets itself and the country into trouble by failing to leave decent legislation alone. The Sawtooth NRA, while per haps not perfect, is working. I urge Congress to make the decision not to designate more wilderness within the SNRA; 10 years of neowilderness has worked in the White Clouds. Let&#39;s leave well enough alone.

Senator McClure and committee members, I speak  as a resident of Idaho on my own views.     As a resident of Idaho, a taxpayer, a hunter and sportsman, I  vigorously oppose the opening of more roadless areas for economic  development.  Having resided in Idaho all my life, I have seen a lot of areas  logged or otherwise developed. Corporation giants go in and clearcut the land, then leave a few standing trees along a windy ridge  top to seed the clearcut. With the coming of the first windstorm,  these unprotected trees are blown down and no other seeding is  provided. The brush soon takes over, and it becomes impossible for  a new crop of trees to grow. The clearcut becomes useless. It is next  to impossible to hunt it, the timber companies especially on their  own land forbid anyone to cut firewood on it. And it soon become a  wasted area. Is this good resource management? If those clearcuts  were replanted and taken care of, a new crop of marketable timber  would be growing on some of them right now. Instead of doing that,  the timber companies are trying to push into our last remaining  roadless areas. Certainly, logging does help wildlife habitat to a  certain point. But after a few years the brush no longer provides  good browse. And it is even a loss when it concerns the game habitat.  I have worked as a guide and packer in the Selway-Bitterroot  area. So I know how nice it is not to have to fight those menacing  clearcuts. I have also hunted logged areas that have been some  good game producers.  Since the Selway-Bitterroot is the closest roadless area, I would  find it pleasing to know that somewhere closer there might be another roadless area to set aside for undisturbed hunting and recreation.  529  I have backpacked and seen some of these areas mentioned,  mainly the Kelly and Cayuse Creek drainages and the Great Burn  area. Some of this area is the finest game habitat I have seen. Disturbing it would greatly unbalance those game herds. Some of the  areas I have seen are high sub-Alpine areas with little or no trees.  Are we going to cut down the only one that might stand on those  high rocky crags?  As a taxpayer, I am equally angered by having to subsidize the  timber companies because the timber value in some of those areas  is low. Why not put some of that money to work hiring people to  help replant clearcuts that now could be profitable timber stands?  The Forest Service says that with their better erosion control  methods none of the trout streams will be damaged. It will only  take one heavy siltation to ruin them. And how do you protect a  freshly cut logging road from a high mountain cloudburst?  In much of this area that I have visited, I noticed a lot of roads  were beginning to have large iron gates on them with the words  &#39;Road Closed.&#39;",,JOHN SPENCER,"TROY, IDAHO",Spencer,John,h2d2,"spencer, john",Selway-Bitterroot (LANDFORM); Kelly and Cayuse Creek (STREAM); the Great Burn (WILDERNESS); Alpine (STREAM),text

Thank you, Senator. My name is Antone Holmquist. And I&#39;m from Troy. And I&#39;ve spent much time in the wild  and have worked two seasons for Canyon Ranger District, which  contains about half of the Mallard-Larkins area, an area comparable to the Selway-Bitterroots in scenic value, wildlife, fishing, and  hunting. There is ample elk, deer, bear, moose, badger, et cetera,  plus a very suitable population of mountain goats.  The Forest Service plans to extend the road up Isabela Creek to  log the drainages up to the Hemlock, which is unmarketable. Now,  I spent one summer surveying Canyon District roads for erosion, et  cetera. And I can assure you of the country being steep and the soil  being decomposed granite and unstable. But the new roads would  be just like the existing ones and would tend to slide down the  mountainside. We as taxpayers would pay for this road be it credits  to the timber companies.  The history of logging in this country is one of cutting old growth  and moving on. First, the hardwood forests of the east, then westward. And now what is left is steep and hard to get to. It wasn&#39;t  until post World War II housing boom that the Forest Service land  was sought. If we log these last remaining lands, we will soon be in  the same situation and left with nothing but rocks and snow.  722  Idaho needs to diversify its economy. The old growth timbers  should be replaced by an expanding pulp industry. The southeast  will be headquarters for saw logs. Wilderness provides long-term  for various industries including outfitters and sporting goods  stores. Hunting and fishing licenses add to the State economy. This  area will continue to grow. And we need more wilderness, not less.  I&#39;m in favor of the core areas proposal by the Idaho Conservation  League, et cetera. This is a moderate proposal to open up about  one-half of the de facto wildernesses to multiple use. The timber industry proposal to save only 9 percent of the last parcels of wilderness is a pittance compared to the total acreage of our great state.  Thank you.",Thank you.

Thank you Senator McClure and Senator Symms. I appreciate this opportunity of being here and I appreciate your ef forts in trying to obtain a cross-section of the sentiment of the people of this great area. I would say to you that these areas, many of them that have been mentioned as possible wilderness areas, I have been riding over them as much as any other individual, maybe more than any individual that I know of in the entire east ern Idaho. I&#39;ve walked them since the turn of the century, or at least since 1915. I&#39;ve seen that under the management of the Forest Service these areas are improving. Actually, the Garns Mountain is in better condition this year than it was 20 years ago, or 30 years ago. The west slope of the Tetons is in better condition now, as far as vegetation, wild flowers, trees, et cetera, where the bugs have, for a bone of contention, have destroyed millions and millions of large bole pine. These large bole pine are tipped over, crossways and this ways, like that. It would be almost impossible for moun tain goats to get in to these areas where the down timber is, as far as a truck path.

I have more than a half century of experi ence farming and ranching in Idaho. I served 29 years as senator and represenative in the Idaho State Legislature. I have served on many boards and commissions deal ing with the management of public lands. I believe strongly in careful and reasonable use of our renewable resources. I believe that we must protect and preserve our beauti ful surroundings. I interject here, I don&#39;t believe wilderness desig nation will add one more beautiful cliff, one more beautiful tree, one more beautiful wild flower. However, this environment should  773  not be locked up for the enjoyment and benefit of a very small mi nority as the wilderness designation provides. The U.S. Forest Service is managing the public lands in a way that provides the most good for a large majority of the people. When wilderness area is created, 90 percent of my friends are locked out of that area because they are not able to walk long dis tances, are unable to ride horses, or don&#39;t have the money to buy or rent them.

I believe that those that advocate wilderness are a very self ish few who are against the whole productive mentality that has made the United States the best of all nations to live in, to work in, to vacation in. Those of us who are limited by either time or resources may still get to our Federal lands with a minimum of either to enjoy and learn from these lands. However, I believe a wilderness classification would revoke these privileges for many who desire to visit a specific location. I, too, am selfish and concerned for my neighbors as well as myself, Edberts, Tuckers, Engets, Davis, Phillips, Balls, Lairds, Nagles, McCulloch, and others who also graze sheep in these fur ther planning areas. We have all had sheep in these areas for gen erations. Siddoway sheep presently run 8,000 ewes with 12,500 lambs in these forest lands. We have fairly good access into Rauiey Creek and Smokey Hollow in Palisades. There are passable roads into Moose Creek, Phillips, and Green Mountain areas, which I use to supply our camps and check our sheep. In a wilderness situation, predator control is restricted, access is restricted, grazing would un doubtedly be restricted. Who knows how far or how many restric tions would eventually be imposed? To deviate here, it&#39;s also a nesting place for insects, pine needles, predators like the grizzly bear, and coyotes. Quite frankly, the sheep industry is in a very fragile state right now. Let&#39;s not let this wilderness deal be the straw that breaks the back of the sheepman. I need the Palisades Creek, Elk Creek, Moose Creek, Siddoway Fork, Pine Creek, Mosquito Creek, Dog Creek, Game Creek, Burbank, and Green Mountain, and Thousand Springs for my oper ation, while all my neighbors need equivalent land in the West Slope, Lionhead, and Palisades areas. As previously stated, we have had sheep in these mountains almost since the conception of the U.S. Forest Service. I&#39;m generation No. 4, and No. 5 is beginning to learn right now.

Thank you, Senator. Senator McClure, I have some questions for you to think about. How are you going to explain to your grandchildren what a wil derness was? Do the people of Idaho have any chance at all against  the corporations who want to exploit us and our resources? ASARCO, a corporation that wants to strip mine in the White Clouds, is a defendant in litigation brought by average citizens such as farmers, native Americans and over a thousand of ASARCO&#39;s own employees, all of whom claimed damage to their lives and health by ASARCO. But people apparently matter little to the company.  In fact, lawyers for such corporate interests have misrepresented  constitutional rights lawsuit in an attempt to gain acccess through my yard not for the public, but for the large corporate in terests the lawyers actually represent. Corporations promise jobs and minimum negative impact. Cyprus Mine and Bunker Hill show how these promises are not kept. Challis has over 200 empty houses, a high crime rate and other social problems the city&#39;s fathers and mothers never antici pated. And the future of Cyprus Mine is still uncertain. I know, be cause Challis is the county seat where I live. Kellogg and the surrounding communities up north are devastat ed. Corporations use employment as a leverage against the people of Idaho. Many are afraid to speak out. But so many of us want this wilderness, and we have a hard time being heard. Today we are fortunate. But don&#39;t forget, wilderness brings income from tour ists, a continuing renewable resource with relatively little impact on the environment. I&#39;m an Idahoan by choice. Idaho&#39;s environment and people have given me inspiration, sustenance and the courage to stand up for what I believe is right.

Thank you for this time to speak. I think it&#39;s obvious by now that a large majority of the people of Idaho and the United States want and need more wilderness. What little we have is heavily used. What we don&#39;t have cannot be in stalled later. There will be more people and more wilderness use. What there won&#39;t be more of is places that qualify for designation     as wilderness. It can&#39;t be manufactured or produced. All we can do at this point is save what little wilderness has escaped development  and exploitation. Although there are a number of disguises for the opposition, they all boil down to one thing: the corporate bottom line. Molybdenum strip mines in Idaho&#39;s back country are not in the interest of the people of Idaho or the United States. Moly is worth about as much as dirt right now, and the oversupply of it will not diminish for at least a couple hundred years. There is a very small class of people in this country whose inter ests would be served by such mines; the people who own the oil companies. Cyprus Mine up Thompson Creek on the Salmon River is owned by Amoco Minerals, which is owned by Amoco Oil, which is owned by Standard Oil of Indiana, which is fairly hard to find out unless you know where to look. ASARCO Mining, which has large moly claims in the White Clouds up the creek from our ranch, is owned primarily by Stand ard Oil of California. What interest would an oil company have in developing a very expensive mining operation for a worthless substance? In a word, taxes.  What a lot of people don&#39;t realize is that a strip mine such as Cyprus, or the proposed Castle Peak removal, is basically a way for an oil company to rechannel profits made elsewhere back into their own department of exploration, research and development, not to mention",,RICK SORENSEN,"STANLEY, IDAHO",Sorensen,Rick,h1d1,"sorensen, rick",the United States (COUNTRY); Thompson Creek (STREAM); Salmon River (STREAM); White Clouds (WILDERNESS); California (STATE); Castle Peak (LANDFORM),text

I represent the St. Joe Valley Association. And I certainly agree  with their position.  St. Joe Valley Association is an organization of citizens who live  along the St. Joe River in Benewah and Shoshone Counties. We  strongly support the principles of multiple-use land .management  and are deeply concerned with the economic health of the communities within our area. We are acutely aware of the importance of  these hearings and their effect on allocation of land to specific use  which will have a lasting impact on our way of life in the St. Joe  Valley.  We favor and support a final wilderness bill for the State. It is  time that the issue reach final resolution and we get on with the     business of sensible land management. In recent years the delays,  withdrawals, resubmittals, and often the abandonment of timber  sales has wreaked havoc with both the industry and the Forest  Service. The uncertainty of timber resources has caused panic sale  purchase amongst industry. This has created artificially high prices  for timber stumpage that contributed to mill curtailments and closures during recent lumber market downturns. It also made the  risk of capital investment to expand the industry in our area too  great. Both have cost our local community jobs.  We do not favor further wilderness in Idaho. There are presently  some 3.8 million acres thusly classified. Enough is enough. We  think it essential the land base for multiple use be preserved as it  now exists. The Forest Service has broad authority to allocate use  of specific areas to other than timber management. Classification  of the land in multiple use rather than wilderness does not mean  the land will be devastatingly logged as many wilderness advocates  would attempt to have the public believe.

In my occupation, I see first hand the results of what are supposedly improved timber harvesting practices. Selective cutting is  not a common practice.  I encourage you to go and see for yourself. Go on a rainy day.  Watch the streams and creeks Idaho&#39;s famous for turn brown with  precious top soil washed down from clearcuts. Throw your fishing  line in that murky water and see what you come up with. It&#39;s undeniable we have made grave, perhaps irreversible, mistakes in our  management of natural resources in this Nation.  We continue to hear claims that we need more timber. Meanwhile, landfills all over this country are used in the burying of perfectly useable lumber from demolished buildings. We are a wasteful people. But we can change.  337  RARE II gave North Idaho Systems the opportunity to support  or oppose added wilderness designations in the Panhandle Forest.  Respondants came out in support of designating as wilderness most  of the acreage under consideration. Comments were never solicited  from other U.S. citizens who along with you and I are the caretakers of our great national forests.  I support inclusion of all remaining untouched roadless areas in  the Federal wilderness system. We owe this to our children and  those who will care for this funny little mixed up world.

I&#39;m Bill London from Benewah County. We&#39;ve all  learned how economics affects us. In the last 2 years, I ve certainly  figured out how it affected me. But I don&#39;t really believe the rationale being used to say that we must harvest the last of the wilderness areas, roadless areas or almost all of them by the timber industry. There&#39;s a lot of reasons for timber problems in north  Idahoâ€”money problems in the timber industry. And amount of  timber is not really one of them as far as I can see. There&#39;s a lot of  available wood. There&#39;s a lot of contracts that are uncut. There&#39;s a  lot of logs left in the woods that I personally have seen and have  been hauled away. The problem is not amount of trees. The problem is competition from the Southeastern United States, the coast,  et cetera.  Another point is that the present roadless areas be considered  wilderness. And, generally, the most remote, the most low price-setting forest. The moneys that&#39;s going to be spent putting roads into  those places is going to be generally true, anyway, to be more than  the value of the timber coming out. It&#39;s a short-term solution that  causes us to subsidize us paying taxpayers in the United States to  subsidize cheap wood. The subsidization of cheap wood does not encourage its intelligent use. What we have seen is inefficient use of  wood throughout the United Statesâ€”the history of the United     States. And it&#39;s not going to change if we continue to subsidize it.  Also, of course, that roading roadless areas is going to result in  more erosion and a lot of consequent problems. For example, right  now they&#39;re worried about dredging near the Clarkston and Lewiston. One of the reasons they&#39;re worried about that is because of  erosion of the Clearwater River this spring. There&#39;s a lot of longterm effects that we have to consider about roading roadless areas.  Much harder to reforest those areas at much poorer success rates  for plantations in those areas. We need wilderness of all types. We  don t need wilderness just at Alpine Lakes. We need wilderness of  all sorts of ecosystems.  It&#39;s been a good opportunity.",Thank you.

Today I would like to present  factual geologic data on area 1-141 and 1-664 which lay in Shoshone County northeast of Murray, Idaho. This data is being presented  by myself with the permission of some of my clients, MINEXCO,  Inc., and McGillivray-Neel and extracted from the U.S. Geological  Survey GP Map 830 of which a copy is included in this presentation.  32-427 0â€”84 26  394  Both of these areas are on a Precambrian Basin which contains  numerous significant mineral deposits and mines of gold, silver,  lead, copper, and zinc.  Both of these area are on the access of a major northwest trending fold structure. Many of the mineralized occurrences are associated with acid intrusive centers that are shown on the USGS map  as high magnetic centers. Three of these which fall within the two  wilderness review areas.  Both the Prichard and Revillie formations are exposed in these  areas. And both of these formations or their respective equivalents  are known to contain major stratographic mineral occurrences in  the United States and Canada.  Both of these areas contain old mines and small number of production. Both of these areas have a significant number of unpatented lode claims owned by both small and major mining companies,  which are presently being explored.  In the south central part of Unit 1-141, MINEXCO, Inc., through  the use of geology, geophysics, and geochemistry, has defined a  northwest trending favorable area that is about 5,000 feet long and  500 to 2,500 feet wide.

Senator McClure, members of the committee, my  name is Tom Wilson. I reside at Sandpoint, and we appreciateâ€”my  wife and me appreciate the opportunity to offer our views on the  wilderness situation in Idaho.  We wish to go on record favoring proposal 4 in your issue update  providing for additional acreages to be added to the Idaho Wilderness system.  We are graduates of the University of Idaho, class of 1937, my  wife in journalism and I in forestry and range. In the past 50 years  we have lived and worked in Idaho, Montana, Washington, and  Oregon. The last 24 years we have lived in Sandpoint.  We have hiked and fished and hunted in the Selkirk Crest areas,  Coeur d'Alene, St. Joe, Selway, and Clearwater areas. We feel you  are doing an invaluable service for this and future generations in  providing legislation to protect and preserve portions of these  areas. Setting aside portions of these areas will have minimal  impact on local employment or the national economy. True, it  could reduce the amount of timber available for future cutting, but  I feel we can and must do a better job of managing our present cutting areas. The past few years have shown that employment opportunities are affected more by timber demand than by timber  supply. Many present contracts have not been completed and many     companies have petitioned the Forest Service for extensions and  special considerations in completing existing contracts.  From personal experience during the past 24 years I have seen  pristine, roadless drainages in the upper north fork of the Coeur  d'Alene River changed into roaded, clear cut units, adversely affecting elk populations, watershed runoff, and scenic values. It is  imperative that we have an occasional virgin stand and undisturbed drainage to study, evaluate, and enjoy.  For the above reasons I hope special consideration will be given  to Long Canyon as a gateway into the Selkirk Crest area. Long  Canyon is one of the few unroaded drainages in Boundary County.  Economically it would be marginal at best to log the 200 million  board feet.  Other areas which we would like to see preserved are:  Salmo-Priest: At least 10,000 acresâ€”important habitat for the  woodland caribou.  Selkirk Crest: At least 125,000 acresâ€”very little commercial  timber, exceptional scenic and recreational values.  Scotchman Peak: At least 20,000 acresâ€”marginal timber values,  excellent scenic, recreation and wildlife habitat values.  We sincerely hope most of these areas can be saved from road  building and logging by designation into the Wilderness system.  We know most of the roadless areas in the national forests eventually will be roaded and logged. We need to reserve portions of these  areas and we are glad to see you addressing the problems with  your legislation.  Thank you very much, Senator McClure.","Thank you, sir.

It&#39;s indeed an honor and a pleasure, Senator  James McClure, ladies and gentlemen, and the news media, to  have something to say in this very important subject: Proper management of our national forests.  I am Ed Nettleton, born in Coeur d'Alene in 1910. I worked for  the U.S. Forest Service from 1930 to 1940, and since then have  been in the lumber industry for the past 45 to 50 years.  I pray daily that our children, and children&#39;s children, as did our  forefathers and myself, enjoy the wonderful God-given resources in  this U.S.A. This can only be accomplished by proper management.  Utilization is true conservation. However, in the last 30 to 40  years, our liberal policies set up by Federal bureaucrats have disregarded our past practical experiences and knowledge, and are setting our great forests on fire; I think a gross mismanagement.  In late summer 1970, a forest ranger in Bonners Ferry, Idaho,  contrary to the advice of some others, started a forest fire in the  Ball Creek drainage, the last large fire that I personally worked  on. This fire cost the taxpayers well over $1 million, and destroyed  millions of feet of timber, plus leaving the drainage in very poor  condition for reproduction.  I&#39;m going to skip a few here now and go on down to the last fire  that was started late in May of 1983, up by Kingston, Idaho, approximately 500 acres of timberland at a terrific cost to we taxpayers.  220  Now, the Sierra Club, Audubon Society, and so-called Friends of  the Earth, want to set aside more and more wilderness areas such  as Long Canyon Creek in Boundary County.  They use scare tactics such as destroying our endangered species,  namely the wolves, grizzly bears, snail darters.","The rest of your statement will be placed in the

Senator McClure, my name is Sherry Dodson.  I live in Sandpoint, Idaho. I would like to talk about what I consider a religious or ethical or moral issue of this issue if you will  permit me.  I feel that we areâ€”we haveâ€”we as humans have come to think  of ourselves as the caretakers and, also, the managers of our  planet. Several philosophers have made theâ€”have stated the  thought that we are not the owners but the caretakers of our environment. And I feel that in recent years that the focus of that concept has shifted to one of we are the owners and/or managers of  our environment. We often talk about managing our wilderness  areas.  I feel very strongly that we are not more important than any of  the other elements of our environment. That we have intruded  upon those elements of our environment by exploiting them in a  way that is detrimental to not only the other elements of the environment existence but also to ours. I feel that it is now time to  back up a little bit and save a little space for the rest of the world  to go on its natural path.     I think that, one, we can realistically do that is by designating  some pretty large areas of what&#39;s left of our wilderness as areas  that will be left alone. And I think that if you make a strong wilderness bill, it will be a step in the right direction.  I also think if you make a strong wilderness bill, it will be an  assurance to your constitutents that you are, in fact, responsive to  our needs and wishes here.  I would also like to quickly read a short letter from Mayo Cupan  of Sandpoint who was not able to be here today. She says: &#39;Dear  Senator McClure, this letter is to encourage the designation of the  Selkirk Crest to the wilderness area because of its unique characteristics.&#39;","We&#39;ll put the balance of that in the record.

They are appalled at  the prospective change taking place in their areas. And they have  love for this natural beauty. And they would like to keep it. So  when my husband and I retired, we came to Idaho in a large part  because of its wilderness areas. We felt that these areas would restrict large concentrations of people from settling in the State. And  they would also keep the heavy industries from moving in and polluting our area.  Thanks to our wilderness areas, we have some of the cleanest  water available in America today. And we can thank our wilderness twofold for just being there to trap and slow down our water  supply and again for holding out industry.  It is through these wilderness areas that we&#39;re attracting a lot of  tourism which is one of our great industries up in this part of the  country. And we feel that for our grandchildren that are to be left,  we would like to leave just a small portion of this wilderness area  so that they might be able to see and enjoy what we&#39;re enjoying  now.     In addition, there&#39;s a number of reasons that we have for this  that we feel that with the tourism, there must be something there  that&#39;s attracting all these people that are coming into our area to  see the wildlife and green forests and the uncrowded life that we  have in our area. So I feel that I&#39;m not a native of Idaho, but I  chose to live here because of the wilderness areas.

They&#39;re the  easiest and certainly the most cost effective when you&#39;re out there  picking. And after picking those big ones, who wants to go back to  the little tiny ones.  We can&#39;t think of the trees in Long Canyon as we do huckleber-  ries. For one thing, huckleberries will grow back in a year. And  they&#39;ll be there next year. And you can try again. The trees won&#39;t     grow back in a year. In fact, an old growth forest won&#39;t grow back  an old growth. At least not for many, many generations and only if  it&#39;s left alone.  Also, the trees in Long Canyon are not just trees; but they have  another factorâ€”another important factor. And that&#39;s their wilder-  nessâ€”their use as wilderness. These trees might be real fun and  easy and cost effective to log. But once they&#39;re gone, there won&#39;t be  any old growth forests left in North Idaho. When this bill is writ-  ten, please don&#39;t think of Long Canyon and Salmo-Priest area in  terms of the trees they hold.

We must harvest our trees and use them to the best advantage, not let them rot  301  or burn. After we harvest them, like a farmer, replant for our next  generation.  On August 2, 1983, I flew in a helicopter over the Long Canyon  area. We land on a sandbar two-thirds of the way up the canyon  and walked through the timber. It is quite obvious that the area  needs to be harvested. The Alpine pine and spruce are dying. The  white pine is overmature and showing signs of rot. There is a lot of  down material on the ground which is building fuels for a fire. The  contour of the land and the good soil makes it a proper place to  harvest and replant for our next generation.

My name is Paul Vogel. I am an attorney practicing  law in Sandpoint, Idaho. Senator McClure, although I would like to  commend you for taking the time and seeking input from Idaho  citizens on a proposed wilderness bill, I feel it is necessary to  remind you and to point out to all people present that public lands  in the State of Idaho belong to all of the people of the United  States.  The National Wilderness Act declares that it is the policy of the  Congress to secure the American people of present and future generations and benefit of an enduring resource of wilderness. This  statement of policy needs to be considered to balance out the  claims of people who oppose wilderness on the grounds that less  wilderness results in more jobs for the Idaho wood products industry. Whether we like to admit it or not, the economic impact of wilderness on employment figures in Idaho is not that great of a concern to the citizens of the other 49 States. What is of concern to  everyone in the United States as expressed in the policy of the National Wilderness Act is that this country have wilderness areas  now and in the future. The fact that there are few wilderness areas  left outside of the Western States is a compelling reason to heed  the desire and needs of all people to have available to themselves  and their children wilderness areas in which to visit.  I&#39;m also a wildlife ambassador for the Idaho Fish and Game Department. As such, I find their failure to recommend Long Canyon  317  and the Selkirk Crest as wilderness to be somewhat of a shocking  decision. I note that they supported the Salmo-Priest area because  of the habitat for the woodland caribou. Woodland caribou&#39;s habitat also includes Long Canyon and the Crest. Wilderness designation for either one of those areas without the other would serve  very little practical purpose for maintaining the caribou.

Long Canyon is an ideal candidate for a wilderness area because  of the old growth stands of trees, because it ties into the Selkirk  Crest Area, and, also, because the proposed Pacific Northwest Trail  would pass through it.  As a wilderness area, it would be a real economic asset to Boundary County. It would help the tourist industry. Something that the  residents of Boundary County are starting to take more seriously.  Also, being able to live in a community near a wilderness area is  attractive to many people.  The Forest Service is a very effective machine for cutting down  trees but not nearly as effective in providing for the real needs of  an area. Particularly the long-term needs. Because of subsidized  road building, for example, areas which normally would not be  logged are logged. Sales of timber in the Long Canyon drainage  would not pay for the cost of building roads. Road costs there are  estimated to be from 50 to 250 percent higher than in other areas.  If it wasn&#39;t for Forest Service subsidization, this area would not be  327  considered for logging. With the subsidization, even the most difficult areas can be made profitable to the lumber industry. In fact,  the more it costs to build roads, the more money flows back into  the local community.  While subsidization may have been a reasonable approach when  virgin timber supplies were plentiful, it is not today. It is making  communities do what is really against their long-term interest.  If the Forest Service is going to subsidize, I would like to see  them subsidize more reforestation and selective logging on a sustained-yield basis.",,JOHN VAN ZOMEREN,"SANDPOINT, IDAHO",Van Zomeren,John,h2d1,"van zomeren, john",Boundary County (COUNTY); Bonner County (COUNTY); Selkirk (LANDFORM); Selkirk Crest Area (WILDERNESS); Pacific Northwest Trail (TRAIL); Long Canyon (LANDFORM),text

My name is John Harbuck. I own and operate a  small wood products manufacturing business in Sandpoint.  I would like to address the question of multiple use as it relates  to wilderness. The Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act mandates several uses to be considered when managing our national forest  lands: Timber, forage, watershed, wildlife, and recreation. Wilderness classification allows or enhances four of these five uses; only  the timber option is foreclosed. Intensive timber management, on  the other hand, can be deleterious to these four.  Idaho is a wilderness State. Its large acreage of undeveloped land  pervades the consciousness of its residents and has a profound influence on their lifestyle. Idaho cannot afford to compromise its  character by mandating development for its remaining unprotected  roadless lands.  North Idaho currently has no designated wilderness areas, but it  should. The Salmo-Priest should be so designated to protect its old  growth cedars and its mountain caribou and grizzly habitat. Long  Canyon as the last major unroaded drainage in the Selkirks with  its old growth forests and the Selkirk Crest with its beautiful  alpine lakes and granite spires together make a gem of an area.

All three of these areas are important grizzly habitat as recognized by the Forest Service; and the areas lay within two of the  five recognized viable grizzly ecosystems in the lower 48: The Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Ecosystem and the Selkirk Grizzly Bear Ecosystem.  The Great Burn/Cayuse Creek and Bighorn/Weitas Areas on the  Kelly Creek District of the Clearwater National Forest should also  be classified Wilderness.

I would like to speak in favor of wilderness  designation for Salmo-Priest and Long Canyon in the Panhandle  and Bighorn/Weitas and Great Burn/Cayuse in the Clearwater National Forest. Each of these areas does contain timber, but each  has other, more important values.  Salmo-Priest has virgin forests, mountain caribou and grizzly, all  three endangered entities. Together with the contiguous acreage in  Washington, the area would make a spectacular wilderness with  the combination of high peaks and dense forests that set America     apart from other nations.  Long Canyon is the last major unroaded drainage in the Selkirks; that uniqueness alone should be enough to qualify it for wilderness status. It also has old growth forests, essential habitat for  pileated woodpeckers, fishers and martens, and a wonderful opportunity for soul-renewing solitude. The latter is becoming ever more  important as the population and development in north Idaho increase.  The Bighorn/Weitas and Great Burn/Cayuse are home to one of  the largest elk herds in Idaho, world class trout fishing in Kelly  Creek, numerous deer, moose, bear, bobcat, cougar, beaver, and  osprey as well as the endangered Rocky Mountain timber wolf. God  gave these animals as much right to life as He gave us. Humans  have amply demonstrated that we cannot share the land we claim  as habitat with most other creatures. Therefore, land must be set  aside where, while we are not excluded, the needs of wildlife come  first.  One of the most remarkable things about the Bighorn/Weitas  and Great Burn/Cayuse is the incredibly clear water. Even after  weeks of rain, the streams are like finest crystal. Logging and  roads, with their unavoidable disturbance of the ground cover,  muddy streams and can damage spawning grounds and lower the  quality of fishing.  The above areas are already providing the multiple uses of watershed, recreation in the form of hunting, fishing, skiing, hiking  and off-road vehicles, and some grazing for the pack stock of outfitters. That is enough to ask. Let timber harvest happen elsewhere.  Thank you.  347","Thank you. Mr. Johnson, I would infer from

your statement that you&#39;ve devoted some time and special atten-

tion to the caribou. Is that correct?

Mr. Johnson. Yes, sir.

The Chairman. Have you verified from your own work the range

of the mountain caribou?

Mr. Johnson. We have a lot of records south of the border in

what is now the proposed Salmo-Priest. We have fewer records

from Long Canyon and very few from the Selkirk Crest.

The Chairman. Are there any records with respect to Long

Canyon?

Mr. Johnson. A few. I would say less than half a dozen that I&#39;ve

received at least.

The Chairman. Yes. Some others have told me that they have

not seen an actual sighting of the caribou in Long Canyon although

the habitat may be appropriate.

Mr. Johnson. I have a couple records, at least, of sightings and

others of tracks.

The Chairman. Is it correct that the caribou generally when

they are south of the Canadian border in Idaho or in northeastern

Washington, it&#39;s wintertime sightings?

Mr. Johnson. Well, it seems to be. But we have records from all

months of the year. And it would be incorrect to say that they are

only there in the winter. That would be incorrect.




The Chairman. And for Mr. Meyer, you indicated, I think, that

you were going to supply further statement later. I wanted to make

sure you knew that September 2 was the cutoff date on those state-

Hello. I&#39;m 36 years old, and healthy, and capable of  visiting the wilderness areas. And I like the outdoors. But as far as  I can remember, I have never visited a designated wilderness area  in the United States. Although, statistically, I should be one of  those citizens that may be often cited as being indifferent toward  wilderness since I&#39;ve never been there.  I&#39;d like to speak for myself as being one of those who has not  been to a wilderness and what do we have to say.  I live in Sandpoint, Idaho. And I&#39;ve often taken walks behind my  house in the forested hills. As I hike along the many logging roads  crisscrossing the whole area, I try to imagine what those hillsides  looked like before they were ever altered by man, before the big,  tall cedars and bull pines were cut. And I can see the old rotting  stumps there so I know how big the trees were at one time. My  imagination takes me through dark, cool cedar groves and through  the territory of my neighbor, the grizzly bear.  I will never find that imaginative forest or that grizzly bear in  my backyard. But I know that I can still see them by going to Long  Canyon or Salmo-Priest. And even though I have not yet visited a     wilderness area, just knowing there are still a few relatively pristine places is a great comfort to me.  We should always remember that man&#39;s incredible ingenuity enables him to alter in just a few minutes or days what took hundreds of years to create. If you want to permanently change the  natural order by using the resources it offers, I think we should  make darn sure we need them. Because once we change them, they  cannot be restored to their original state within our lifetimes. I believe we have already lost too much of our wilderness long, long  ago. Two hundred years ago. And in my opinion, Senator McClure,  you cannot put enough wilderness into this bill. I ask you to include as much as you possibly can. And I support the Endangered  Idaho Wilderness Core and I strongly oppose hard release language.","Thank you very much. Brad Chinn. Mr. Chinn

Idaho&#39;s national  forest drew us to the area, especially the beauty of the wilderness  areas.

The lure of wilderness is vital  to continue to draw tourists into Idaho.  I urge the Senator to design his legislation so that the maximum  wilderness area in the State is preservd for future generations. The  Endanderged Idaho Wilderness Core should be preserved in tact,  especially the rugged Long Canyon-Selkirk Crest which I have personally hiked and Salmo-Priest which is our primary next recreational goal. It would be a loss to all of the economy of the Panhandle if roads intruded into these unique wilderness areas.  Finally, I want to strongly object to hard release language for  any Idaho wilderness bill. The citizens of this State are opposed to  any plan that would lock out our ability to decide what is best for     us in the future. Not only would hard release prevent us from correcting any mistakes that we as falable humans might make in the  current selection process, but it would also disenfranchise future  generations.

I am here today representing myself and my hus band, who was unable to attend today because he is working. We are both members of the Idaho Conservation League. My husband works as a river and backbacking guide in the summer, and we manage a Nordic skitraining center in the winter. Our livelihood is based on the recreation industry and the preservation of wilderness areas.     In the past few years we have seen a logging and mining indus try falter under the heavy blows under the recession while recrea tion has remained consistent. In Salmon, Idaho, where we live, out fitting and guiding, as well as local merchants and businessmen, have all benefited from the protection of roadless areas and the promotion of Salmon, Idaho, as a recreation area. Many jobs have opened as a result of this promotion. Wilderness areas need no longer be misinterpreted as economic waste or lockup, but rather a very well built economic asset, con sidering the recreation industry, is a viable resource. The recrea tion industry expands on its own. We have yet to see a Govern ment subsidy for recreation as we have seen deficit logging and  mining subsidies â€” are not national forest lands â€” our subsidies and deficits picked up by the already overloaded Government welfare system. We are not opposed to the logging and mining industries but feel it is time for the recreation industry to be given merit and areas protected for recreational use. My husband, Bill, and I support the conservation proposal, which is presently being drawn up, for the addition of public lands to the wilderness preservation system. We specifically endorse the Lemhis, Garns, Borah, Pioneer, and White Cloud Ranges. Particu larly on the White Cloud, we support a nonmining clause.

Hello, my name is Michelle Bottaro and I&#39;m from Salmon also. I am talking for myself and also for Cheryl Hart who couldn&#39;t make it today. .1 wish to testify at this hearing because of the need to protect Idaho&#39;s roadless areas. Once a road goes into an area, the area is changed forever. The wildlife that exists there is forced into small er and smaller areas. I think that economic issues are not suffi cient grounds to warrant the destruction of undisturbed natural habitat caused by roadmaking. I strongly oppose the hard release approach that bars any further consideration of specific roadless areas as wilderness. It would essentially mean less wild land than we have right now becasue with the said places, we would no longer be protected. It is normal for timber sales on my range or district to be deficit sales; the Government does not make money. We do not regenerate trees fast enough to continue at past harvest rates. The Northfork ranger district has more potential at this time, I feel, to manage for recreation. The Salmon River runs west from  681  Northfork and has a large river floating as well as camping impact. Eight or so years ago, no one floated the day stretch of the Salmon     commercially. Now, there are three or more companies that float that stretch regularly. The Forest Service allows launching of eight permits of up to 30 people apiece daily from Corn Creek for the roadless area afloat. I understand that recreation industry is the third largest industry in the State. It seems to be growing in the Salmon River area and creates seasonal new jobs locally. The areas affecting me personally are the Lemhi Range and the West Big Hole. West Big Hole deer and elk migrations have been disturbed by roads and logging. Game that was plentiful 20 years ago is now only seen occasionally. Our area is heavily hunted each season with differing hunting dates for Montana and Idaho. We must leave someplace for the herds to go by allowing a combining with Montana&#39;s West Big Hole wilderness. I urge the inclusion of the endangered Idaho wilderness core as a minimum in your legislation. Thank you for considering my views.","Thank you very much.

I&#39;m Hadley Roberts and I live in Salmon. I&#39;m a pro fessional wildlife biologist. Until recently I retired from the U.S. Forest Service after 32 years of Federal service, and the last 12 of which were a wildlife biologist on the Salmon and Challis National Forest. I&#39;ve come today to talk about the North Lemhi and West Big Hole bowls. Those are the two I have the most knowledge of, based mostly on past jobs and hundreds of hours, or I should say days, backpacking, fishing and hunting in the two areas. I have a lot of background information which I don&#39;t have time to read, but I would like to go into what has happened recently in the Lemhis. The Salmon National Forest started logging in the area about 15 years ago. They started with a series of sales on the lower slopes at the edge of the sagebrush, cutting many of the small patches and stringers of important big game cover. Since then they have gradu ally worked up the slope. The Forest Service cut over these low timber productivity lands using mainly a shelterwood system which, according to silviculture books, should produce tree regen eration. This has proved to be false, as the method has been a com plete failure in the Lemhi Range and many other parts of the Salmon and Challis National Forest where Douglas fir has been logged. Areas cut within the last 15 years still have no more trees now than on the day they were logged. Hundreds of miles of roads have been constructed to haul out low grade logs. Nearly all of these roads are still open to travel. I know of only one successful attempt by the Forest Service to close roads in the area adjacent to the Lemhis. That closure resulted about a year ago only after a great pressure from the public and Idaho Department of Fish and Game. These traveled logging roads disturb big game animals and cause them to avoid the roads and a wide band adjacent to it. In addition, the constructed roads usually  32-426  0 â€”84  44     682  lead into a proliferation of four-wheel drive trails which radiate from the constructed road, causing further disturbance. What does this mean? The most serious impacts of logging and roading have been to the big game species. Reduction of hiding cover and high open road densities have caused mule deer and elk to abandon traditional areas and move higher up the slope. The end result is a shrinking land base of critical habitat and a reduc tion of carrying capacity. The current Salmon National Forest 5-year timber action plan shows that this trend will continue, with more sales being planned for critical summer range areas. The overall effect is obvious. Habi tat potential will continue to decline, which will eventually precipi tate a sharp decline in animal numbers, with a special emphasis on elk. Local ranchers have voiced their concerns to the Forest Service about these sales, but they have reached only deaf ears. Because of this indifference to their concerns, I understand an appeal is being prepared for one of the sales currently being offered. Many resi dents of the Lemhi Valley have sen enough cutting and roading in the Lemhi Range. They enjoy their present lifestyle which includes the lack of manmade intrusions. An increasing number feel that a wilderness classification is the only way to protect these values. I have a little bit more on the West Big Hole. This has not been impacted as the Lemhi Range, but it will be in the future. There are no plans for timber sales within the next 5 years in the West Big Hole proposal, but I&#39;m sure it is to come. I am favoring that the Lemhi Range be put in the Idaho wilder ness bill, and also that the West Big Hole be placed in the Mon tana wilderness legislation.",,HADLEY B.

Thank you Senator McClure, for the opportunity to testify here today. My name is Richard Smith and I am a dentist and businessman from Salmon, and I&#39;ve been there for a number of     years.  I would like to state that I support the multiple-use concept for our national forests; however, living on Salmon, why, it&#39;s very evi dent that the Forest Service manages our lands to favor one use at the expense of others much, if not most, of the time. Usually that use is timber. Now, that&#39;s not necessarily bad, I&#39;m not saying that, but there are times when different uses should predominate. Some areas have unique and valuable natural qualities that are different from others, some are wildlife habitat, others are timber-growing areas, and some have both, a mix of each. Timber values are some times low and should at times help to tip the balance toward em phasis of other uses. An instance such as I am describing is found in the North Lemhi Range of mountains, an area recommended through the RARE II process for wilderness designation by the U.S. Forest Service. I would like to join others here today in supporting the creation of a Lemhi wilderness area. I have brought a map, and you have it there before you, sir, of some of the proposed boundaries that quite a number of us support, and would mention that generally the boundaries are drawn to exclude commercial timber producing lands. One exception to this is a small intrustion into portions of the controversial Eight Mile and Mill Creek timber sales, which have been opposed by a majority of the Upper Lemhi River resi dents.  And Senator McClure, I believe some of them have been speak ing to you about this, and I know that there are not very many ways in which a Senator can address this problem. And it&#39;s a Forest Service problem, but here is one that they were talking about today. The Lemhis are primarily used for grazing and provide a valua ble watershed for ranches in the desert valley below. They are rela tively little used by out of State recreationists but much prized and appreciated by the local and regional Idaho citizens for the moun tain grandure, sparkling lakes, and unchanged vastness contained there. We would like to keep it that way. Rapid proliferation of the roads and use of motorized transportation has quickly changed the majority of our area and will continue to do so. We ask that a pres  687  ervation of the current conditions and commercial use of this area be prescribed by Congress. The Wilderness Act allows for continued use of grazing; but to further protect and qualify the rights of range permittees, I would suggest that wording be added to the enabling legislation, so that nothing shall be implied by the wilderness designation of this area which shall cause a reduction of livestock numbers, and that graz ing systems shall be no different from what would be allowed under current management criteria for nonwilderness land. I feel this is compatible with the wilderness values to be found there be cause what we have there is what has resulted from current man     agement.  Also, I believe that language should be included so that existing livestock management improvements shall be maintained, recon structed, or relocated as necessary, and that any change in materi als to be more compatible with a natural appearance not be done at the expense of the permittee or to the detriment of his livestock operation.

Timber has long played a vital part in our community, and it should continue to do so. Ranching is an excellent use of our fer tile, irrigated lands.

Now, in Salmon National Forest we have a large wilderness area and we have a large recreation forest. don&#39;t think anybody knows exactly how much of their money we spend. We spent $275,000 last year and we received about $5,000, just a little under a 2-percent return. And then they are complaining about a 20- to 30-percent return from our timber roads. Many of these areas do not think anybody realizes what costs to put a trail into any of these areas. Salmon National Forest last miles. The average cost $23,000 for year let go a 3-mile trail; 3  it  I     it;  I believe that the future looks good for all of our resources and my point is simply this: We need to give each one an opportunity to prosper. Where timber can be harvested and replanted in a sus economical, consider where grazing tained manner, consider as a land use; where mining can be done efficiently and the land restored promptly, consider it; and where clear recreational values exist, utilize them. Specifically, here in the northern Lemhis we have one-of-a-kind recreational asset; we are not making any more areas which have such significant wildlife populations, undis turbed watersheds, and overall natural diversity. disappearing commodity, and Simply put, undisturbed land may not always have a dollar value, its relative worth will while always increase. The Northern Lemhis, in particular, are an awe some reminder of the land which greeted early explorers on their way west. These lakes, valleys, and mountaintops should remain unspoiled for others to witness. We have no better use for this land than for grazing and recreation, as was just eluded. The decision should be straightforward; please include the Northern Lemhis in any wilderness bill. Thank you very much.","Thank you.

cost is between $3,000 to $20,000 per mile for each road, and these




are the figures that I received from the Salmon National Forest,
from the engineering department, from the financing department.
They do not include many of the areas where money was spent.
There was $65,000 spent on Williams Creek Road. There was
$150,000 spent on the Salmon River Road, almost all of it as recrea
tion. This comes out of the general fund; there is no money, it was
just appropriated.
So the actual recreation â€” the money that we spend on recreation
in the Salmon Forest is way above what anybody thinks. They re
ceived hardly any and they should, if they are going to try to close
many of these areas down, then they should be raising the cost. If
you are going to pay â€” if you&#39;re going to make money off of it and
pay the Forest Service $5,000 and that is complete â€” well, $5,170
was the complete and total price that the Forest Service received,
and they spent over $275,000. It&#39;s very small money. Nobody says
that we&#39;re â€” they say they don&#39;t spend any money for recreation.
It is a very large expenditure, and they should, if they&#39;re going
to, they should raise the prices for all areas, recreation included.",BRUCE CROOK,"SALMON, IDAHO",Crook,Bruce,h1d2,"crook, bruce",Salmon National Forest (FOREST); Lemhis (WILDERNESS); Northern Lemhis (LANDFORM),text

I think I&#39;m the person you&#39;re looking for. Lunch  isn&#39;t far off here.  Let me define what I call the regional approach. Our region,  north Idaho, 50 miles east and west, and 150 miles north and south  deserves some automony on certain issues. As we have our own  river and lakes, our own roads, our own share of taxes, and our  own multiple-use logged land, we should have our own share of wilderness.  My north Idaho regiona has some 5,000,000 acres in it. It is in  dire need of some true mutliple-use management. A modest figure  of 76,000 acres set aside for wilderness seems only minimally appropriate as this represents one sixty-fifth of the total land or 1.8  percent of north Idaho. Five million acres of wilderness is what we  white man started with 300 years ago, and we&#39;re using it up rapidly. So, I guess Long Canyon, Selkirk Crest, Salmo Priest, and  Scotchman&#39;s Peak are the four areas to fulfill this modest proposal,  equaling around 76,000 acres.  I also brought for you a little of the Long Canyon area here. I&#39;d  like to have you see these pictures somehow. Photograph 1 represents a valley just south of Long Canyon; photograph 2 is Long  Canyon; and photograph 3 is a valley which has a little bit of a     burn in it, so it looks a little odd, but as you can see, I think that  what might explain some of the excitement over the area, the place  has been logged. You get up in an airplane, and you see continuous  clearcuts. The oneâ€”pictures 1 and 2 are just about all clearcut, 20,  30, 40 percent of that valley. I think that might explain some of  the excitement over the issue. It seems the logging industry might  use a little management, maybe, rather than the forests.  My last comment, I&#39;d like to squeeze it in, would be about Salmo  Priest. I&#39;ve been up there extensively inside and out of Idaho and  Washington, inside the proposed boundaries. I think no matter  what Washington does, we ought to make ti wilderness anyway.

Senator, I&#39;d like to make these two points. I&#39;m in  favor of wilderness in general. And I&#39;m particularly in favor of  Long Canyon and Salmo Priest being wilderness. Like many people  in this area, I value the feeling of living in this part of the Country. And the fact that there is wilderness is a big, big part of that  feeling. It seems sometimes like the question that we ask her is  asked wrong. It seems to be put in the form: How much wilderness  should we have in Idaho? We already have a lot. How much more  should we add? And it seems to me it&#39;s a question, really, of how  much should we subtract? We have de facto wilderness now which  is a very big part of the feeling of living in this part of the country  rather than many other parts of the country.  I&#39;ve lived in Europe where, as far as I know, there is no wilderness whatsoever. Every square inch of ground has been impressed  upon by mankind. But out here it feels a lot different. I think it&#39;s a  very important part of the American experience. The question is,  then: how much of what we&#39;ve got do we want to get rid of? And  when you look at a couple of key places, like, Long Canyon, you  say, &#39;Well, how about Long Canyon? Let&#39;s get rid of that as wilderness.&#39; And I think when I look at it, when I fly over it, when I talk  to people that have been through it, my answer is: Let&#39;s not get rid  of that as wilderness. Let&#39;s keep that one spot in North Idaho just  as it is.  246  I think one quick other pointâ€”there&#39;s always talk about the fact  that Idaho has in proportion to other States much, much more wilderness area. But it seems to me that this is very natural. New  Jersey is not a very good place for wilderness. Kansas, for another,  is not a very good place for wilderness. It seems like Idaho is the  wilderness area for the whole country, in part.

Thank you, Senator. I&#39;m Dwight Robinson. Perhaps you&#39;re wondering why many persons like myself would drive  over 100 miles from Sandpoint to Coeur d'Alene just to say a few  words of testimony on wilderness areas that they have never visited.  Well, Senator, the reason why I am here is to convince you that  our wilderness areas should be considered as a trust fund to be     used for ourselves and for future generations. These areas should  not be allowed to be exploited by the timber and mining industries  for the sake of a quick profit. It is true I have never visited Long  Canyon in the Selkirk Crest nor Mallard-Larkins or the other  areas outlined in the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core as of yet.  However, while working at the Trout Creek Ranger Station in  western Montana, I did witness areas of devastation performed by  the timber industry. Why, Senator McClure, did they log Beaver  Creek and leave the logs strewn across the streambeds and clearcut  water storage areas? Senator, I have witnessed this and other areas  of very poor management. And, obviously, the Forest Service  should accept some of this responsibility.  The timber industry has proven to me beyond a doubt they are  not trustworthy to harvest timber on our Forest Service lands let  alone in wilderness areas.  Will you, therefore, please consider adopting the Endangered  Idaho Wilderness Core as a minimum trust fund to be set aside for  future generations.  Remember, Senator McClure, the cliche: &#39;Idaho is what America  used to be.&#39; Let&#39;s keep it that way.  In review I wish to say I propose the 6.5 million acres of National  Forest lands which are still roadless to remain that way. Also, I  wish Senator McClure to include the Endangered Idaho Wilderness  Core in his legislation. In addition I urge Senator McClure not to  include hard release language in his bill because hard language  would permanently ban future wilderness consideration for areas  not now classified.  32-427 0 - 84 24  362  Thank you.",Thank you.

Thank you, Senator.  There&#39;s a lot we could talk about. And I&#39;d like to focus on one  particular area, the Great Burn wilderness proposal which straddles the border between Idaho and Montana. In particular, about 1  month ago it was my pleasure to visit an area in the upper headwaters of Kelly and Cayuse Creek, a little lake basin known as  Goat Lake. Its a tremendously open country. The fires have  burned through. You can actually see the border where the fires in  the earlier part of the century burned some of the area. And lower  down on the Silver Creek, the rest of the area was left unscathed.  And you can see in that area evidence of the low timber value in  that drainage. The treesâ€”such regeneration as there is is spotty  and growth is obviously poor.  One thing that really amazed me about this areaâ€”and I have  not before ever had an experience like itâ€”was the contacts I&#39;ve  had with wildlife. We were in thereâ€”a friend of mine and Iâ€”for 1  night. That&#39;s all we had time for. But it was an easy hike into the  area. It was a nice trail that goes in about 3 miles. And immediately, coming into the area, it was quite obvious there was good game  habitat. We saw mule deer does as we came into the basin. And  after dinner in the waning hours of light, we took a walk up into     the divide between Goat Lake and Williams Creek area. And as  soon as we reached the topâ€”reached the divide and looked down  into the basin of Williams Creek, we saw about 11 elk. It was amazing. They were sixâ€”no. Yeah, sixâ€”six cow elk and five calves. It  was delightful. They were bedding down for the night. A little wary  about us being there. And that wasn&#39;t the end of it. In just a few  minutes before the Sun went down, we got back to camp and found  some goat hair on top of the ridge. There are certainly goats in the  area. We found a couple of white-crowned sparrow nests there in  the heather of the area. It supports a lot of heather. And it&#39;s a  great habitat for that little bird. And coming back into camp as we  looked down from the top, down into the camp, I saw a doeâ€”a  mule deer doe nosing around my kitâ€”my cook kit. And she was in  camp with us all night long.  All this is to say that this area is obviously a wonderful and rich  and diverse area for wildlife habitat. And I believe wilderness protection is an appropriateâ€”is the best protection of the area. And I  would like to see that area protected and the adjoining areas of the  Great Burn. I think it certainly deserves it. And this may soundâ€”  for some reason and not a very good reason this sounds outrageous.  But I would like to give you the opportunity to see that area. And I  would be delightedâ€”in fact, I&#39;m sure there are a number of people  in this room who would be happy to show you that area. It  wouldn&#39;t be that hard to see.

Mr. Petry. I represent the 174 members of the Whitman County  Sportsmen&#39;s Association, over 60 percent of whom live in, fish,  hunt, or backpack in Idaho. We create a considerable amount of  economic benefit in your State and we are highly familiar with its  resources.  I personally am a full professor of finance and by training and  profession have had considerable involvement in wildlife economics. I have had six grants involving fishing economics totaling over  $300,000 in the Northwest covering Washington, Oregon, and  Idaho.  We highly endorse the Great Burn Wilderness Area that has  been proposed for the Kelly Creek and Cayuse Creek areas. This is  a premiere hunting, fishing, and backpack area. We are highly disturbed that the Forest Service would spend several hundred thousand dollars to survey and stake the area near Cayuse Creek despite enormous public opposition and without having timber stand  data or an approved environmental impact statement.  We have considerable difficulty understanding why the Forest  Service has so much money to develop low-value timber areas in  sensitive soils and when the wildlife values are so great. It appears  that they have incidental interest in wildlife and view their jobs as     primarily timber harvesters.  In a period of huge budget deficits, how can we even pretend to  justify spendingâ€”no, I should say, wasting taxpayer money. If the  Idaho congressional delegation allows the travesty that the Forest  Service is planning for the Cayuse Creek area, then this will be a  vote for corporate welfare. If I were an entrepreneur who owned  the Cayuse Creek/Kelly Creek area, the only way I could make  much money would be to manage it for recreation. You would go  broke managing it for timber.  We have lost confidence in the Forest Service&#39;s ability to be an  objective manager. I personally spent 100 hours analyzing the benefit/cost study they produced for the Cedars unit which is adjacent  to the Kelly Creek area of the Clearwater National Forest. The  enormous number of errors and unsupported statements caused me  to more than question their objectivity, it caused me to wonder  about their ability and even their integrity. I have included a copy  of my analysis of the Cedars unit for the record.  Now, let me just cover a couple of the items in the exhibit. The  No. 1 benefit they claim in the Cedars unit was hydro power. You  cut down the trees so the water flows down the slopes. The second  thing they did is they overstated employment related to logging by  125 percent. They also reclassified large number of logging roads to  shift the cost to recreation. And they substantially understated  recreation days and projections. And that&#39;s right in there.  I hope that trust in the Forest Service can be restored, but it  won&#39;t be by their bull-in-the-china-shop attitude.  The Idaho delegation has a well deserved reputation for being fiscally conservative. A good way to further that image and reduce  620  the Federal deficit would be to cut the Forest Service&#39;s road-building budget. They obviously have far too much money if they would  even propose to put roads into a high quality recreation area.",Thank you very much.,GLEN PETRY,"WHITMAN COUNTY SPORTSMEN&#39;S, ASSOCIATION, PULLMAN, WASH.",Petry,Glen,h2d2,"petry, glen",Pullman (CITY); Washington (STATE); Oregon (STATE); Great Burn Wilderness Area (WILDERNESS); Kelly Creek (STREAM); Cayuse Creek (STREAM); Creek (STREAM); the Cayuse Creek/Kelly Creek (STREAM),text

My name is Robert Wallace. We&#39;ve heard economics batted around here quite a lot today. I happen to be an economist. I mention that because it indicates I have some familiarity  with the general principles, anyway. Well, there are a lot of good economics, Jim; but  you&#39;re not going to give me time for that in the 3 minutes.  In the past 48 years, to indicate my credentialsâ€”for the past 48  years, I&#39;ve been on the staff of 12 universities in this country in  eluding twoâ€”three Big Ten and two Pac Ten. Most recently,  UCLA last winter. So I am familiar with the general problem.  Mr. Kromer indicated that we all were either on one side or the  other here. And I don&#39;t think that that necessarily must be true  particularly as I look at the question of the Kelly-Cayuse-Toboggan  Creek problem where we hear repeatedly that it&#39;s not economically  viable. That it requires a subsidy. Assuming as we all at least pay  lip service to it that we believe in the American system, the free  enterprise system. What does that say about how suchâ€”how any  resource should be used? We say, &#39;Well, our resources are scarce.  We want to use them, allocate them according to what the public  wants.&#39; So what it means is that if you don&#39;t run your business in  such a way as to produce what the public wants, you go broke     unless the Government steps in and distorts that allocation by  giving you some money to carry out an activity that you cannot  carry out without support. Because what it means very simplyâ€”if  you can&#39;t cover your cost without subsidy, all it means is that the  public would rather have those resources used somewhere else in  some other activity and presumably is enabling the other activity  to outbid you for the resources.  So what I&#39;m saying is that I can&#39;t address myself to the facts in  Kelly-Toboggan-Cayuse Creek area. But if it true, we&#39;re all agreed  that&#39;s its pretty superb wildlife-recreational area. If it&#39;s true that  the proposal to build all these roads is not economically viable  based on the timber that&#39;s there, then I think that the American  system, the free enterprise system, suggests that we probably ought  to leave it as it is.

I started my teaching career at  Boise High School in 1966. And my salary at that time was $5,000.  I&#39;m a user of wilderness areas. But I don&#39;t consider myself an elitist.

I would ask that  those areas be included in the Great Burn Wilderness Area. Specifically after listening to testimony today, I would hope that that  road that&#39;s into that area would allow access as it presently does  and that somehow we could make that a boundary area. I wouldn&#39;t  support logging in that area. But I would hope that there could be  735  wilderness from perhaps a guard station on without the inclusion  of that road. If it hadâ€”if we had to exclude that road and make it  a wilderness designation to prevent logging in that specific area, I  would support that.  The last thing I guess that I&#39;d like to say is that I, as Mr. Greenfield has observed, have heard several testimonies today that seem  to blame the acquisition of wilderness areas on unemployment in  Idaho. And I would hope that somewhere in your investigation,  Senator McClure, that you would see if you could verify that fact  that there can be a connection.

But realizing that  the fact that a lot of people&#39;s jobs are on the line here, I think that     there are certain areas that should be opened up. I think testimony  by the expert people who spoke todayâ€”and I mean everybodyâ€”I  think you can weigh the choice one way or the other which area  should be opened up to timber. But in the long run, you know, the  fate of everything rests on us. Either we screw it up or leave it  alone.

If at all possible, I think all 6V2 million acres of roadless areas in  Idaho should be protected as wilderness in spite of the fact that  many wilderness opponents speak to the portion of Idaho lands  that are already designated as wilderness. But when we consider  the percent of Federal lands protected as wilderness, Idaho is  unique in containing such a large portion of undeveloped, roadless  land. And I feel it is our responsibility to protect this remaining  land in the national interest.  I would also like to make the point that virgin timber has  become a hated term in the forest industry. The very notion of pro-  tecting this resource is considered a foolish refusal to capitalize on  the high value of a rare and disappearing level of quality in the  lumber business."," Thank you very much for your statement.

Senator McClure, staff members, and fellow Idahoans, I am testifying only for the members of the Claude Simpson  family from our permanent home of Priest Lake.  I recommend that the committee consider the addition of approximately 40,000 acres to the Idaho Wilderness Area. The land I  am proposing for addition lies between the northern slope of the  Two Mouth Creek drainage area and the southern slope of the  Abandon Mountain drainage area. The four factors involved in my  recommendations are: One, Lion Creek and Two Mouth Creek  drainage areas are the breeding and feeding grounds for the whitetail deer; two, the Abandon Mountain drainage areas are the trek  routes for moose and blacktail deer; three, a wilderness area as rec   ommended will provide nature the opportunity to heal the present  wounds on the land. It will also permit rehabilitation of the  streams for spawning beds for the wild cutthroat trout and the  dolly vardon both of which are in or near the endangered species  list.  I wish to state that I do not object to multiple use of primitive  areas.  Senator McClure, I believe there is sufficient knowhow, manpower, and brains in the United States to devise ways to permit multiple use of our lands without tearing up the entire landscape. The  technology is here now. But it is not being used as it is slightly  more expensive to harvest trees and to carry on a mining operation  in a wilderness area.  308  If we want to really be concerned about the economy of the great  State of Idaho, I would recommend that we devote our energy and  resources to the tourist industry and develop good State-supported  camp and recreational facilities.

It is my personal conviction that we, as a region, must begin a  conservative era in discharging our natural resource management.  North Idaho deserves a share of that conservation; call it an investment in the future; Idaho&#39;s future. Therefore, I request wilderness  status for the area in Boundary County known as Long Canyon.  I realize the level of emotionalism, confusion, and the great  length of time in the resolution surrounding the issue. In order to  balance the above, I suggest more communication.  As are most controversies, this issue was born out of poor communication and diverse cultural philosophies. Poor communication  because a group of policy makers in Washington D.C., developed  criterion under which we were to classify and use our unique geography. Poor communication because the words used by those policy  makers are shadowed in misinterpretation and misunderstanding.  Diverse cultural philosophies because each side has chosen their  boundaries based on a set of values that cannot be crossed by the  6  other side, and an inability to accept an admixture of each participating philosophy.

In spite of that, having spent most of my life there and knowing  that canyon probably better than anyone else, I don&#39;t think it  should be logged.

I&#39;m Jackie Johnson. Good morning, Senator and staff. I&#39;m here to testify for myself. I want to say that I do support  for inclusion in the Idaho wilderness system the endangered Idaho core. And I live in Pocatello and I am specifically interested in adding some areas, some wilderness areas to the wilderness system that would be more accessible to those of us who live in a fairly populous part of a relatively unpopulated State. One area that I am particularly interested in seemed to be in cluded in Lionhead, a roadless area, I was there about 2 weeks ago. It&#39;s an area like many places in Idaho, is astoundingly beautiful, astoundingly wild, and very lightly used. I&#39;d also like to see includ ed specifically Mount Naomi, roadless area, the Italian Peaks, and the west fork of the Main Creek; the west fork of the Main Creek may be particularly important because of it&#39;s proximity to Pocatel lo and its heavy use as a recreation area. The present wilderness designation of land in Idaho amounts to approximately 7 percent of the overall land base of the State. Even if we were to add 3.5 to 4 million more acres to this, in terms of wilderness, we&#39;d still only be talking about 14 percent of the total land base of the State. And this land is not land which is generally productive for other uses such as agriculture and ranchland. I&#39;d like to be ableâ€” when I&#39;m an old woman in my eighties or nineties, hope to live that long, I&#39;d like to be able to not look back and say we told you so; that we squandered a valuable resource, which few other areas in the world, let alone the Nation, can boast their wilderness is as wonderful as Idaho&#39;s. I&#39;d like to be able to  626  look back and say, weren&#39;t we smart, weren&#39;t we intelligent to have the foresight to take care of this wonderful country. It&#39;s true that Idaho does have the largest amount of designated wilderness land in the lower 48 States, but this is true partially be cause Idaho has the largest wilderness area in the lower 48 States.

I&#39;m Linda Burgel of Pocatello. I&#39;m a housewife and     a mother. I returned late last night from a 30-mile backpacking trip so that I could be here today to testify. My two children, who are 8 and 10, were with us on the backpacking trip and walked the  entire 30 miles. I really appreciate this opportunity to voice my concern regard ing wilderness in Idaho. Presently we have 3.8 million acres in the national wilderness system and I support including at least onehalf of the remaining 6.5 million roadless acres in this system. This will protect critical areas for fish and wildlife habitat and for recre ation. I have personal experience with two of the areas that are under consideration. Our family enjoys exploring new areas in Idaho by foot, by canoe, or on cross-country skis. In late June this year, my children and I spent a week backpacking in two of the many drain ages in the Palisades area in the Snake River Range. We hiked miles seeing abundant tracks of moose, elk, deer, and even bear. No tire tracks were visible anywhere. The snow had just begun to melt at 8,000 feet and the spring beauties, alpine buttercups, and other early flowers were just emerging. The children watched the initial formation of streams as the noon Sun caused rivulets of water in the previously dry trail. They began learning how to use a map and compass to navigate. Most importantly, they learned the joy of being self-contained and spending several days hiking and getting to know a new area. We also enjoy returning to familiar areas near Pocatello. The West Fork of Mink Creek in the Caribou National Forest not only provide a portion of the culinary water for Pocatello, but also is a prime hiking and cross-country ski trail. Imagine gliding uphill through untracked powder snow under a crystal clear blue sky and emerging into a wide meadow filled with beaver ponds. That expe rience is the West Fork of Mink Creek in the winter. By the way, the packing area there is maintained by funds col lected by the Park and Ski Sticker Fund. I urge Senator McClure to include the endangered Idaho Wilder ness Core in his legislation for the protection of crucial wildlife and fisheries habitat. I oppose the hard release concept. Soft release would allow our children a chance to study remaining roadless areas for possible wilderness designation in the future. Perhaps, with early exposure to the joys of wilderness, they will be able to make better informed decisions than we or our forefathers have sometimes made regarding the use of the land.

That&#39;s me. Thank you, Senator McClure. I endorse the plan with all the 7 million acres presently roadless remain so. And I&#39;ll mention a few of these areas. Certainly the areas identi fied through RARE II should be officially designated as wilderness, also the Idaho Wilderness Core. Additional acreage should remain unroaded as buffer areas. Proximity should be strongly considered in this designation. For example, the West Fork of Mink Creek,  previously alluded to by Linda, is an excellent watershed and rec reational area. It is close to Pocatello, approximately 13 miles away. Another example is Mount Naomi, which has extreme diver sity in terrain; it&#39;s in the southern part. A special case is the Lemhi Mountain Range, the longest unroad ed range in the lower United States. This is a pristine area with fragile mountains â€” fragile meadows, excuse me, and easily roadable soil. It has excellent wildlife habitat, and the opportunity for solitude is great there. Contrast this area with the mine along Patterson Creek, which is in the Forest Service terrain, this is an EPA nightmare. The qual ity in the area is a nightmare. We could save taxpayers money by not replacing the road on East Fork Pasture Creek that was washed out this spring. There is really no reason for this road, es pecially given the possibility of wilderness designation. Another area is the Pioneer Mountains. Once again, proximity is important, and it&#39;s one of the three great Idaho Mountain Ranges, the other two being the Lemhi and the Lost River Range. Other areas in the Idaho Wilderness Core deserve special consideration as well. The White Cloud/Boulder area, where I believe the prohibi tion on mining is needed. The Gams Mountain area, which is fairly close to Idaho Falls, and should be given consideration because access is available early in the area, which is a contrast to the rocks and ice type of wilderness that we presently have. The Garns Mountain area also has access to wildlife habitat. Palisades area, proximity again, this is an intact area with miner, timber, and mineral values and should be given wilderness designation. Despite the Multiple-Use Concept and Sustained Yield Act of 1960, the National Forest Management Act of 1976, and the Wil derness Act of 1964, Forest Service has placed heavy emphasis on short-term single-use projects. Timber and mining can be single-use projects, and in often cases are. Special interest groups, such as log gers, miners, and farming organizations, have dominated Idaho pol itics and policies, making private commission development the fore most use of public lands. What has happened to the commission of the U.S. Forest Service, which was to manage for the public good, not for private exploita tion, and to foster conservation, not waste? Though initially estab  728     lished to provide stewardship to public lands, the benefits of wilder ness or the current roadless status have been ignored in the past forest plans. Along with the benefits are watershed protection, which is the original grazing, for instance, is the reason the Forest Service was developed, scenic preservation, scientific laboratory â€” observations, recreational opportunities, and wildlife habitat. Many of these benefits are enjoyed by the people who visit areas and are not, for example, water quality, scenic values that can be enjoyed without ever having entered the area.

The Issue Update states that 6.5 million acres should be designated wilderness. My reasons for wanting this are  762  as follows: man does not live on this planet alone. It is necessary one or for humans to have plants, animals, and microorganisms. ganism becomes extinct, the balance will be upset and may cause other organisms to become extinct also. For example, one cannot  If  have the monarch butterfly without the milkweed. The leaf cutter bee is essential for pollination of alfalfa. If you don&#39;t have water fowl refuges in the north, there will be no birds to fly south. you have no refuges in the south, you will have no birds that will be coming north, these roadless areas are filled with species that we do not wish to see become extinct. And I&#39;m not talking about big game, necessarily; I&#39;m talking about small things like plants and animals and even microorganisms. No. 2, if you don&#39;t protect and wisely use what you have, you won&#39;t have it for long. For example, ancient history records show that Mesopotamia with the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers was once a fertile area. Civilizations grew and flourished there, and that in cludes Babylon, Assyria, and Persia. Because they did not take care of their land, it became unproductive, and what we have at the present day is Iraq and Iran, and you know how barren that is. This is not an isolated example. There may be some excuse for the ancients not taking care of their land, but with our technology and knowledge there will be no excuse for us. Cutting trees will change the watershed, often causing floods. The level of the ground water is already changing all over the United States. Mining causes a change in the acid base balance. Some pools in mining areas have a pH of 1, and in this pH no plant or animal can exist. No. 3, there is a relatively new science called biotechnology or genetic engineering. This involves taking the deoxyribonucleic acid from one species and putting it into another to produce a new plant, animal, or microorganism. In this fashion new, bigger, more mutrious, and drug resistant â€” or disease resistant organisms can be produced. This promises to be one of the industries of the future, resulting in jobs and in a better way of life. Therefore, it is desira ble that no species in the forest or the grassland perish because we must have this pool of DNA. Now, all the facts aren&#39;t in yet. The future may be full of surpris es; we owe it to posterity to preserve our heritage. Small tracts of land are as valuable in this sense as are large ones, and it&#39;s prefer able that they be scattered throughout the State. In closing, if the people of the Amazon and the Himalayas are determined to destroy their heritage, I mourn for them. But I hope that we will not be that stupid. I want the wilderness where man is himself a visitor, all 6.5 million acres of it.","Thank you. Chuck Trost.



STATEMENT FROM CHUCK TROST, POCATELLO, IDAHO

Mr. Trost. Thank you, Senator. My name is Chuck Trost, and I
live in Pocatello, Idaho. I have lived there for about 15 years. I&#39;m
an environmental scientist an ornithologist and a bird watcher. I
don&#39;t hunt or fish, but I do enjoy backpacking and I do enjoy wil
derness. I realize that nearly 8 percent of Idaho is already designat
ed as wilderness, which makes it the largest system in the lower 48
States. However, I would like to see even more so designated, such

763
as the proposal No. 4 you recommended in your questionnaire, Sen
ator. In the first place, I do not feel that wilderness designation
hurts the economy of Idaho, but, rather, it is greatly enhanced just
because of our existing wilderness. This is true for both the local

economy and the entire tourist industry.
My primary reason for favoring more wilderness, however, is
that such designation maintains and insures a scientific control or
yardstick with which to measure the effects of human disturbance
on every land. Only through having such a control or reference
system can we understand the subtle effects of the many ways we
are currently modifying the environment. Most of our existing wil
derness is in a large chunk of central Idaho. While this is a tre
mendous resource, I feel we need also to have many smaller areas
of diverse habitats represented in the wilderness system. Such is
lands of wilderness in a sea of human disturbed land are necessary
to measure both local impacts and more global insults, such as acid
rain. Without such control areas, it is very difficult to predict envi
ronmental perturbations. Such predictive ability will increasingly
become important as we become more proficient in ecosystem man



agement.

Therefore, I support the endangered Idaho wilderness core areas
as recommended by the Idaho Conservation League and other con
servation groups. I would like to specifically mention several of
these areas I have explored. The Garns Mountain Area of the
Targhee National Forest is close to the population centers of Idaho
Falls and even Jackson Hole. It offers a diverse array of environ
ment and access routes. I have floated the south fork of the Snake
River and seen mountain goats there. I have skied into a wilder
ness hut run by a Driggs guide in the heart of the winter, and let
me tell you, it&#39;s a beautiful sight.
The Northern Lemhis of Salmon National Forest offer a tremen
dous area of alpine vegetation and not much usable timber. Many

of the alpine plants found there are at their southern limit in the
State, and relative ease of access makes this area a good area for
education. The Borah Peak areas of Challis National Forest is a
place close to my heart, too. In addition to the highest peak and

only glacier, this area includes a huge fossil deposit of ancient and
extinct coral formations. It is always a sensory shock to stand on
top of a mountain surrounded by thousands of Paleozoi sea crea
tures; almost as if the ocean had just withdrawn, instead of 3 mil
lion years ago.
I have led several field trips into these remote peaks with their
ancient life just to share the uniqueness of the area. In the Caribou
National Forest there are several areas that deserve mention.
Mount Naomi receives considerable use from Utah people, but
many Idahoans would explore it, too, if it were designated wilder
ness. Such designation automatically caused an increase in inter
est, and its presence along with several others in southern Idaho
would remove some of the recreational pressure from central
Idaho.
The west fork of Mink Creek is another area that&#39;s close to
home. It already is a natural research area. It&#39;s a rare example of
an ungrazed woodland in southern Idaho. It is a valuable control
area for understanding the impacts of grazing on forest ecosystem.

764
is only minutes from Pocatello, and I enjoy skiing there. There
is â€” I have seen bald eagle and it also serves as a Pocatello water
supply. Ironically there&#39;s a motorcycle trail right up the middle of
this research natural area. Wilderness designation would cut out
that use. I&#39;ve found dead snakes in the middle of the road in the

It

Mink Creek Natural Area, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to



have this happen in a place that &#39;s being set aside for research.

I think there needs to be significant changes made in the way  the Forest Service manages the land. Their road building programs  are, at best, ridiculous. There needs be significant changes in those  so that these lands can be managed properly.

This decision which stated that the Forest Service  failed to fully comply with various environmental laws during the  RARE II process has put the future of my family in Idaho on such  an uncertain basis that we don&#39;t even know if building a home is a  sound financial investment. It took 12 years to reach the conclusion of RARE II. A RARE III would take many more years and another huge chunk of taxpayer money for the study. This decision     made in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has jeopardized the  future jobs of about 20,000 Idahoans. It is not fair that 25 percent  of Idaho&#39;s total nonfarm income depends on a court located thousands of miles away.  My husband is a logger; 100 percent of our family income depends on the availability of harvestable timber. Without the roadless areas contained within the boundaries of the Clearwater National Forest, our future, needless to say, is grim in Idaho. I feel  that it is necessary to add a qualifier at this point in my testimony;  roadless areas are not wilderness. When I speak of roadless areas, I  am referring to those areas within the Clearwater National Forest,  where roads have not yet been developed. When I speak of wilderness areas, I&#39;m referring to those areas set aside by an act of Congress to remain untouched by man forever. The roadless areas are  now being managed as wilderness. This process will continue until  the issue is resolved by an act of Congress. If we are going to have  a future in Clearwater County, Congress will have to decide soon.  Last winter, my husband couldn&#39;t find work in our area and was  forced to go to Alaska to support our family. We had never been  separated before and I hope we never are again. We have two  small boys and the responsibility to provide a good life and a future  for them. It is not possible to provide this without a dependable  family income, or the comfort and the stability of a father who is  home with them every night. We will leave this area before we are  forced to become a part-time family to survive.  Approximately 70 percent of the Clearwater National Forest is  currently being managed as wilderness. The vast majority of the  Clearwater National Forest is located within the boundaries of  640  Clearwater County. How can a county government function with  only a small portion of total land area to draw taxes from? Our  schools rely heavily on timber taxes to function. The District 171  School Board has been struggling to provide a quality education for  the children of Clearwater County with an ever shrinking money  supply. It will not be long before there are simply no more corners  to cut. The severity of this problem is staggering. The problem  would be lessened considerably if there is an assured supply of harvestable timber for our county industry to depend on.  The U.S. Forest Service is a group of dedicated professionals who  are qualified to manage Idaho s forest land in a productive multiple use plan for the benefit of everyone. Let&#39;s allow the professionals to do the job that they trained for and the U.S. Government has  hired them to do.",Thank you.

Senator McClure, my family and I live in Idaho  by choice. We have made our home here for the past 8 years. My  husband is head partsman for PFI, Headquarters Idaho. He has  served 6 years on the school board of Joint School District No. 171,  and has had to struggle with decisions to cut back in all areas of  the district because of the lack of forest funds available during the  recent downturn in our economy. These forest funds are vital to  the operation of the schools in our district. They are set aside,     apart from the general fund, for use in the following areas:  REMODELING  Last year extensive remodeling was needed at the Weippe  School, which has a very old building. Remodeling was also done at  the Timberline High School, and new roofs were put on Orofino  High School, Orofino Junior High, Weippe, and Timberline. All  these projects were for energy conservation.  TRANSPORTATION  Forest funds are used to purchase badly needed buses to transport hundreds of kids who reside in the rural areas of the district.  The minimum needed was $150,000 for the buses. With the loss of  forest revenues, the district was unable to purchase the required  number of new buses. These funds are also used to replace wornout  furnaces and heating units and for purchases of land sites for new  schools, shops, and equipment warehouses. The amount of Forest  Fund money the district receives each year depends entirely on the  sale of timber in the area.  Our family&#39;s livelihood has been seriously threatened the past  few years during the economic downturn and uncertainty with resulting extensive layoffs in our area. This situation has caused our  schools, businesses, churches, and individual families to feel the  pinch. I am a member of Faith Lutheran Church Council at Pierce.  We have set up budgets according to the past year&#39;s growth trends,  only to see our income shrink drastically as our members have  been laid off for many months at a time. Many of our members  tithe 10 or more percent of their income, yet a tithe of an unem641  ployment check is a lot less than a tithe from a regular wage  check. In order to be sure our pastor was paid his salary, we had to  resort to applying for assistance to the North Pacific District of the  American Lutheran Church. Yet, our church has a history of being  a giving church. So the very fabric of our lives has been torn by the  slump in forest industry income. And now, as the economy looks to  be on the upswing, the timber industry is moving again, but there&#39;s  still an ominous black cloud over the horizon. The decision in a  California court that RARE II evaluation was not thorough  enough. RARE studies have been going on for 19 years! This means  that available timber to keep the industry moving and healthy is  being locked up in further delay. Some think that the 3.9 million  acres that have already been set aside for perpetual wilderness is  not vast enough. I submit that it would take you and me a lifetime  to explore just the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness alone.  According to Governor Evans, Idaho has only two main industries: Agriculture and timber. The mining has already been closed  down, affecting thousands of jobs. These jobs represent people like  you and meâ€”with homes, families, and businesses. Those who  insist we need more wilderness in Idaho want to see a mass exodus  of taxpayers like me and my family from the State. They want  ghost towns where there were once thriving communities. The  Nation cannot afford for Idaho to become an uninhabited wilderness playground for the liberal elite from other States. Eighty-two     percent of the Clearwater National Forest is commercial forest  land that should be managed in a productive manner.  We need to let the U.S. Forest Service do their jobs. They are  professionals who are mindful of their Stewardship responsibilities.  If the access to merchantable timber is blocked by further timeand money-consuming studies, deciding nothing, the industry will  be forced to leave Idaho, taking 22 percent of our basic industry  wages with them. We must release the roadless areas that are not  designated wilderness for multiple use management so that we can  continue to work for a decent wage, pay our taxes, and live in  beautiful Idaho, our home.",Trent Woods.,LENORE SEMMLER,"PIERCE, IDAHO",Semmler,Lenore,h2d2,"semmler, lenore",Headquarters (CITY); Orofino (CITY); Weippe (CITY); California (STATE); Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness (WILDERNESS); Clearwater National Forest (FOREST),text

Our Nation was built on the principle of free choice and the cre ation of a system which would foster personal, democratic auton omy. We are gathered here today to exercise our right as citizens and to take part in our democracy actively through these hearings. Our national forest and wilderness areas have been designated for the public and should remain that way, useful to the public as roadless areas. Future generations must have the right to free wilderness just as our founding fathers did. And I am here today to do what I can to preserve our roadless public areas as wilderness. I was raised in a family where fishing and hunting and the knowledge of wildlife and their habitats were respected. I moved from Oregon to Idaho not to make a better living, but to live  better. I felt that Idaho was one of the few remaining Western States that still offered a true wilderness experience. We are here today to decide on the future of 6.5 million acres of national forest and this will affect both Idahoans and non-Idahoans alike. The economics of tourism and public use versus the economics of timber and mineral development is a valid point. But the facts and research will never outweigh the truth. And the truth is that we need this land as wilderness. And I&#39;m not only speaking for myself as a citizen of Blaine County, but for the elk, caribou, deer, and mountain goat that in habit these primeval forests, for the salmon, steelhead, and trout that populate the unspoiled waters and for the rare golden and bald eagles who watch over this unspoiled land. I strongly urge that the 10 areas presently under wilderness con sideration be preserved as part of a national wilderness system and that if we as citizens feel that one more â€” that more research time is needed in certain areas that we be given the option of this time to decide on these issues through a soft release or a nonrelease classification.

Senator McClure, I have a quote here from a  Senate hearing 316, February 1973, yourself. &#39;I started to go to  Yellowstone National Park when I was a small boy. And I don&#39;t  enjoy going there as a developed area anymore because there are  too many people.&#39; My name is Richard Walker. I&#39;m a forester by  training and occupation and have been for the past 17 years specialized in wilderness management planning, congressional wilderness studies, and wilderness cultural inventories. My wife and I  live near Peck and manage a portion of our own land as a tree  farm. So we&#39;re familiar with both ends of the spectrum; timber  management on one end and wilderness on the other.  We hear Idaho needs jobs. Well, I&#39;m not an economist. But  whether we like it or not, today we live in an economic and techno728  logical society. The questions of resource availability and allocation  are increasingly being raised because economics is still the name of  the game. It is comparative, then, that we equate natural resources  with capitalâ€”I mean investment capitalâ€”the same thing that is  inheritance from which we might draw interest. Proper management of this capital, our natural resources, insures a continuing  legend to the long-term benefits.  The other route is a short-term respite and eventual bankruptcy.  To address the question of land allocation somewhat more objectively is what I think this hearing is all about. I hope that your  proposed Idaho Forest Management Act will require that a joint  study be prepared by the Forest Service or the forest industry with  full participation by State and local interest that would identify a  sustainable underline; that is, level of timber harvest and the resultant level of employment based on the poor proposal addressed  in your questionnaire. Alternative proposals of land allocation can  then be more objectively weighed.  The alternative proposals and their effects should be presented  in such a manner as to enable the family involved in logging to do  some long-term personal planning. The local community and chamber of commerce with a little more certainty would know how long  the mills will really be around. I mean, the community of Potlatch  would certainly have welcomed this kind of information.  You yourself, Senator, stated again in the same testimony in     February 1973 that, quote: &#39;Congress ought to make the decision as  to what shall or shall not be. And we need some factual information to guide us in making these decisions.&#39; Senator, this proposed  sustained yield study would identify for you and other members of  our Congress, State government, local communities, and individuals who are directly dependent on these natural resources whether the management direction is but a short term or a long haul.  This should not be the individual prerogative of Under Secretary of  Agriculture John Krull  who recently stated, quote: &#39;Sustaining a local or regional economy may mean encouraging production in areas that are not economical.&#39;","Thank you, Mr. Walker.

My name is Verna Groves. I&#39;m acting for my husband.  I live in Parma, Idaho, and own property in the proposed Salmon  River breaks national recreation area near Dixie, Idaho. I am one  of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that has been brought in the U.S.  District Court for the District of Idaho against the Forest Service  proposal to construct an all-weather road in the Jersey Jack roadless area for the purpose of timber sales. I would wish to make the  following statement before this committee: For a number of years,  my family and I have spent a good deal of time during the late  summer and early fall in eachâ€”huntingâ€”each season hunting elk  and deer in the Jersey Jack roadless area. This area currently supports one of the largest elk herds in the State of Idaho. Hunting is  excellent. The hunting season is longâ€”longer than any other area  in the State. And no permits are required for hunting the Jersey  Jack area. We thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to hunt big game  in the unroaded and undeveloped area such as the Jersey Jack  roadless area.  The Nez Perce National Forest plans to engage in intensive road  building and logging activity in the Jersey Jack area in the next 10  years. My own experience with the impact of logging and road     building on game herds and the information provided to me by the  Idaho Fish and Game Department has lead me to the conclusion  that the Forest Service proposal for development of this area will  significantly reduce the quality of the big game hunting now available in the Jersey Jack.  I am therefore opposed to logging, road building in the Jersey  Jack roadless area and wish to express my support for the designation of this area as a Salmon River Breaks National Recreation  Area.  If the standing timber in the Jersey Jack was so valuable that its  removal would provide great benefits to the State of Idaho, our  timber industry, or the Nation as a whole, then I propose that logging in this area might be wiseâ€”a wise choice. But the forest  economists have estimated using the Forest Service estimates of  cost of road and high timber values ever recorded in this area. The  cost of the building access roads to remove the timber will exceed  the value of the timber by a minimum of $4V2 million. It would be  sad enough if the prime elk habitat had to be sacrificed in order to  achieve the greater benefits of removing valuable timber. But that  is not the case. The Jersey Jack roadless areaâ€”the Federal Government plans to spend several million dollars building road access  to timber that has a market value of only a fraction of the cost of  building the roads to get it out.  In these times of fiscal conservationâ€”conservatism, I see no  reason why the current recreational benefits and the big game  habitat in the Jersey Jack roadless area should be sacrificed.  Thank you.","Thank you very much.

Mr. McClure, ladies and gentleman, I&#39;m awful interested in the Idaho wilderness areas concerning every aspect. My  main concern is the Foehl&#39;s Creek drainage, north and just a little  bit west of the Mallard-Larkins Pioneer area.  Speaking not as a hunter and an outdoorsman, I personally  think it would be a shame to let this area be logged off. The fish  and game department has in an aerial flight only sighted 75 known  elk in the area. I&#39;ve hiked and hunted the area for 10, 15 years  now. And I know there&#39;s several more than that along with bear  and cats. And the goats from the Mallard-Larkinâ€”or Snow Peak  and that general area range Foehl&#39;s Creek along the MallardLarkin Pioneer area. And I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll find much better elk  breeding grounds.  371  What usually happens I&#39;ve found with several reports and checking into a lot of reading and talking with people, that the elk generally leave an area when it&#39;s logged. And this area is highly susceptible to erosion. Most all these areas, when the timber does  grow back, it comes into brush. And I think the elk would become  like America&#39;s bald eagle mere extinction to let that go as logging.  And steelhead and trout spawn Foehl&#39;s Creek annually as well as  the North fork of the Clearwater River. This would be adversely  affected by logging in that area.  A few years ago this area was being considered for the RARE II  Act because of its remoteness and single access road. This would  have left only those existing roads with a 20-foot corridor for motorized vehicles. At that time, several logging companies stated  that they had no intentions of harvesting the timber of Foehl&#39;s  Creek Canyon or its drainages. The majority of the timber is hemlock, which is of little value compared to other timber. And it  doesn&#39;t seem that it would be profitable to log hemlock with expenses as high as they are now.",,DANIEL R.

I appreciate the opportunity to speak today, I  am an Orofino resident. And I&#39;m a native of Headquarters, Idaho.  And I&#39;m just addressing a portion of the Mallard-Larkin area.  This area in question is the drainage of Minnisoka and Bear  Creeks which encompasses approximately 5,000 acres. Both Minnisoka Creek and Bear Creek have good healthy stands of timber in  them that should be harvested to enhance growth of remaining  stands.  The terrain conditions in this area range from rocky steep bluffs  on the breaks of the Little North Fork to gradual slopes from the  midbasin to the headwaters. Few intermittent streams fork off of  Minnisoka Creek, but would not cause soil or water problems if logging seasons and road building activities were limited to dryer  months.  The road systems have been surveyed by the Forest Service to  the main ridge north of Minnisoka Creek and could some day be     extended into Bear Creek for future needs. Two system roads have  been laid into the Minnisoka Basin from the 700 road or Smith  Ridge Road system. These roads present little or no problem to  water and soil standards if grades are limited to what is actually  there on the ground and if roads are surfaced soon after being constructed.  The timber that covers this area is thick and reaching maturity.  It needs a sanitation cut or precommercial thinning. The cutting  prescription wouldn&#39;t need to be clear cut blocks to achieve regeneration in the majority of the area. Although some small areas  have old stagnated white pine and hemlock stands with brush already competing with reproduction. These blocks should be clearcut and replanted. All of the white pine in the area has a high percentage of mortality and should be removed earlier for better recovery.  The higher percentageâ€”the higher per cent of slope is going to  determine system of logging with the majority of this being in long  and short line chances because of the nature of the terrain. There  should be, however, some ground skidding units laid out on the flat  ridges and flats throughout the plan area.  Log transportation system could come through two different  routes. The first one being over the existing roads to Headquarters  to Orofino. The second area is still in the planning stages but  should be considered. It would use the same roads within Minnisoka area out the 700 road, down to the new proposed Salmon  Ridge Road which would access a new log dump site on the Dworshak at Milk Creek. This would, no doubt, help the plan area&#39;s ap535  praisal and thus put more moneys back into the site. Something  else this sale would do is to help limit the costs at Milk Creek.  There would be very little or no adverse effects of logging this  area upon the Mallard Larkin Pioneer Area.  There is small amounts of elk sign in the area with only one  major game trail that crossed proposed road profiles.  There was old signs of beaver dams in Minnisoka Creek.  In summary, this site is a good timber growing site and should be  managed as such. I would recommend that this area mentioned be  designated multiple use and the boundary for the Mallard Larkin  Pioneer Area remain where it is.","Thank you very much.

Thank you, Senator, for a chance to speak today.  My name is Ralph Roseberg. And I&#39;m from Orofino, Idaho I am  here to represent a point of view that I believe is shared by a significant portion of that community. As you probably can tell from  my accent, I have not always been fortunate enough to live in  Idaho. Therefore, I can compare the abundant natural resources of  Idaho with other more developed areas of the United States. Idaho  certainly has blue ribbon fishing streams, hunting areas and wilderness recreation potential. These particular resources offer long  term use, income and aesthetic qualities if we have the foresight to  conserve them. In a general economic sense, we have the hunting,  fishing and tourist-dollars which should be considered along with  the highly subsidized and unstable timber industry desires. As an  economist told the Orofino Chamber of Commerce the other day,  the timber industry boom that once was will simply never be  again. An economic recovery, as Doctor Greenspan has recently  spoke about, does not mean a return to the boom of preoil embargo  days. Our economy in the Clearwater area is going to have to be  restructured from a heavily timber dependent one. These roadless  areas offer one avenue that would help do that.  In a more specific vein, I would like to discuss some of these     areas. Cayuse Creek and Kelly Creek drainage make up an absolutely wonderful fishing area that attracts people from all over the  United States and even from other countries. Logging in this and  many of the now roadless areas can only be accomplished by taxpayer financed and erosion causing roads that could be very detrimental to the fishery resources of this exceptionally gifted area.  Some of the terrestrial areas can recover well. But high country  streams like this are very fragile. We have a real gem here if we  don&#39;t throw it away.  The Mallard-Larkins offer a potentially fantastic wilderness experience. And this could become even more evident with time and  thought. There is no timber cut crisis in the Clearwater area now  or will not be one in the near future. So it is not necessary to lock  ourselves into a choice of wilderness or clearcut with a premature  decision on acreages and boundaries. There is no pressing need for  final decision on some of these areas now. Logging areas without  due consideration and time for that consideration have severe consequences as you have seen in the case of the South Fork of the  Clearwater.  Long Canyon offers the last stronghold of roadless and undeveloped natural areas in that part of the State. All of the areas in the  various proposals have merits to consider. But I thought you could  see these to be good examples.  As a taxpayer and outdoor person, I wish you to consider the  minimal timber values of these areas versus the cost to the taxpayers and the loss of fragile and irreplaceable natural resources for  everyone. Many of these rugged, steep areas will cost much more  for roads than they will return to the taxpayers in revenues. Let us  556  not hurry to a final decision that we may regret since there is not  a pressing need to lock up these now roadless areas.  Thank you for this opportunity to express our viewpoints.","Thank you.

My name is Pam Keller, and I live in Oroflno, and I  want to thank you for holding these hearings.  I would very much like to see more wilderness preserved in  Idaho. At the very least, I think that Idaho wilderness, of course,  should receive wilderness designation. Idaho has a lot of wilderness. And I think this is great. It doesn&#39;t mean there shouldn&#39;t be  more. Most of our wilderness is in the central part of the State.  But wilderness qualities are not restricted to one or two blocks of  land in Idaho. We&#39;re fortunate that way. Wilderness is perhaps  most beneficial and enjoyed when it&#39;s scattered and easily accessible to everyone. A little bit of wilderness in your back yard, so to  speak, is good for your environment. All of our public lands should  be managed according to their best use. Wilderness designation  shouldn&#39;t be precluded because there&#39;s wilderness elsewhere. But  the Idaho Forest Industry Council by their own figures said there&#39;s  2V2 million acres of roadless area in Idaho that does not have commercial timber on it. And yet they only recommend 600,000 acres.  This doesn&#39;t make sense to me. There are several roadless areas in     the Clearwater National Forest that have values that far outweigh  their timber values. Specifically, the Great Burn and Cayuse Creek  area, Fish Creek, Elk Summit and Mallard-Larkins and the upper  North Fork. All of these areas are scenic and inspiring. And  they&#39;ve long been popular camping and hiking areas. They&#39;re all  excellent producers of fish and wildlife. I would say that that&#39;s  what they do best. Fishermen and hunters use these areas extensively. Much of this country in the upper reaches of the Clearwater  County has little commercially valuable timber due to huge fires or  the harsh growing conditions. The soils, for example, are often dry  and loose and of low fertility. This makes the regeneration very difficult as in removing the vegetative cover during harvest and road  building can cause great erosion and stream sedimentation, particularly with these soils.  And as far as the so-called conflict between the timber industry  and roadless areas, I think this is overblown. The timber industry  blames too many of its woes on the roadless area controversy. The  roadless area appeals were really preventing the timely harvest of  these areas. Why is there a 3-year backlog of approved timber sales  that have yet to be cut? Forest Service contributions to county  budgets that are derived from timber sales have dropped in recent  years. This has also been blamed on roadless area lockups.",,PAMELA KELLER,"OROFINO, IDAHO",Keller,Pamela,h2d2,"keller, pamela",Orofino (CITY); Clearwater National Forest (FOREST); the Great Burn (WILDERNESS); Cayuse Creek (STREAM); Creek (STREAM); Fish Creek (STREAM); Elk Summit (LANDFORM); Mallard-Larkins (WILDERNESS); North Fork (STREAM); County (COUNTY),text

I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. I was  born in Orofino, Idaho, and currently live in Orofino, Idaho. And I  was raised in Orofino, Idaho, except for a short time in the service,  I&#39;ve always lived in Idaho. I think the main importance in that is  that growing up, some of the most valuable time I&#39;ve spent was enjoying the wilderness or the woods and streams in the North Fork  drainage. I&#39;m here mainly to speak in relation to Cayuse Creek,  Kelly Creek, and Toboggan Ridge. I&#39;m very familiar with the area  having fished it and hunted it a lot. And it&#39;s extremely beautiful,  extremely valuable area for the fishing and wildlife. A friend of  mine, a husband of one of my secretaries, works as a fish and game  biologist for Kelly Creek District. He has been part of a study in  that area as I understand it. And he says that the logging up  thereâ€”well, first, the timber up there, I think, is well accepted by  the people out there that the timber is not worth the value it s  going to cost to build the road. It&#39;s mainly lodgepole pine.  Also, the soil out there is very poor quality decomposed granite.  And the terrain is extremely steep. It&#39;s going to be difficult, if not  impossible, to ever reforest the area once it&#39;s logged if it is logged.  Also because of that, the soil quality and the inability to reforest  it is going to cause a lot of siltation in a lot of the cedar streams for  Kelly Creek and Cayuse Creek which are the breeding streams for     the cutthroat that are in the area and are a very valuable resource.  I think it would be a real tragedy to log that and to harm such a  beautiful fishing stream and such a beautiful country in such a  way that it&#39;s probably going to be impossible to replace.  Generally as to wilderness area and this type of thing, Iâ€”I&#39;m a  lawyer in Orofino. I work as prosecuting attorney in Orofino. And  my financial well-being to a great extent depends on the local economy which is to a great extent dependent on the logging industry.  And I do think that there should be timber available to log. My  understanding of the recent economic problems are that it&#39;s a  result of interest rates and lack of demand rather than a lack of  timber.",Thank you very much.

A true wilderness is something that even animals  avoid because they have to have a trail to travel to feed and water,  moving from higher to lower elevations with weather and time.  We have been pushed to build ramps, doorways, and toilets so  handicapped persons can use public buildings. These wilderness  areas without roads and some trees harvested to provide access for  handicapped cannot bring an enjoyment to those people. Enjoyment of all possibilities such as cold, clean water, fish in water,  smell, and sec mountain flowers.  Locking up more land in Idaho without any income from property taxes has left Idaho low man on the totem pole as far as education. Public owned land has not produced any taxes to buy school  buses or computers.  Locking up oil, gas, and lumber resources puts us in the category  of the man at a planning and zoning meeting, when we wanted to  lock some land into agricultural. When asked what he would do  when he goes hungry, he said, &#39;I&#39;ll go to Safeway and buy beans.&#39;  He did not stop to think that somewhere around a farmer had to  produce the beans, someone had to refurnish the tin, and someone  had to cut the tin, and someone had to cut the tree that made the  label so he knew what it was.

I&#39;m an employee of the U.S. Forest Service Bonners Ferry Ranger District and I would like to express my views  concerning Long Canyon. There are many points we should concern ourselves with, but I&#39;ll have to limit myself to three.  First, as you should know, the first and foremost purpose of setting aside the national forests was for watershed protection, not  timber production. Long Canyon is now used as a control unit for a  number of parallel canyons on the district. From it we accurately  gauge the effects of logging in the other canyons. Without it we  have no real basis of comparison. Long Canyon allows us to make  this honest decision.  Second, there has been some arguments concerning potential  problems of forest fire in this area. The argument being without  road access into the area there is no way to fight the fire. This I  can assure you as a trained firefighter is ludicrous. There are roads  to the top of parallel canyons which could provide reasonable  access to the canyon. There are smoke jumpers who are often used  212  in areas even more accessible than Long Canyon is now. Also, the  very structure of a climax stand inhibits large fires for there is  very little down timber for the fire to build in as is often the case  in managed areas where thinning and logging slash accumulates  and carries the fire. These and any actions, even including the use  of aerial retardent drops, are all sanctioned by the Forest Service,  be it in a wilderness area or not.  The third reason is that Long Canyon is a classic example of  climax habitat types. In order to establish growth potentials the  Forest Service has spent millions of dollars developing a method of  classifying forests according to habitat types. In the length of this  canyon nearly all of these habitat types exist. Nowhere, not even  in Fisher and Parker Canyons does such a place exist. With these  habitat types, we have an excellent laboratory for assessing the  yields, interrelationships between serai and climax species and  plant indicators. To disturb this would be a great silvancultural  loss. I therefore request to keep Long Canyon and Selkirk Crest as  wilderness since there is no other wilderness in Idaho.","Thank you.

So I&#39;ll try to be very  short here and make my one point.  As a realtor from Bonners Ferry, I am concerned for this community&#39;s economic future. I share the county&#39;s concern for the  timber industry.  But any area&#39;s most important resource is its people. I have  watched many quality people come to our area, spend money,  invest, and settle here because of our natural beauty. Long Canyon  as wilderness will continue and increase these needed people dividends in the years ahead. The decision for wilderness will strengthen this paying attraction.  This canyon has remained roadless because of its topography. It  has been too expensive to log. To now log Long Canyon would be a  costly harvest with a low short-term yield for a town that needs a  long-term diversified solution.

Back in the days of RARE II, I helped the vast majority of the  community support the Boulder Creek drainage for multiple use in  logging. And I&#39;ve never regretted it.  However, I can&#39;t feel the same about Long Canyon. Surely we  don&#39;t think that this 3 percent of our timber base is going to affect  our jobs. If this were the case, I don&#39;t think we could plan on being  in the business much longer. I remember back when I started back  in the sawmills back in 1970. I was told that after 10 years&#39;, there  would be no timber left in the county. Well, 13 years later I think I  can always see timber in the county as long as we think better to  not rely on bigger.  What we need is better management in the existing areas and  not to rely on a 3-percent bigger timber base. We&#39;ve all seen marvels of good management and the disasters of poor management.  Good management must be the key and the priority in looking for  future timber supplies.  As a rapidly growing demand in the country, save praise of what  this land once was. And I think Long Canyon is an excellent opportunity to help supply it. And with this in mind, we ask that you  designate Long Canyon as a wilderness. Thank you.",Thank you.

It is true that Long Canyon has become a regional symbol of controversy between different viewpoints and different types of mentality. Both of these viewpoints are of great value and are well  meant in our particular area of interest.  The fact that we find increasingly acceptable substitutes for the  divisional uses of wood indicated that choosing a multiple use designation for Long Canyon, in particular, cannot compare to the  value of living in a wild state. You&#39;ve already heard many of the  reasons for doing this.  I am definitely for multiple use of our national public lands. Especially with good and careful methods of harvesting, our natural  resources have proven economic and feasible.  But not all of the facts are in regarding man&#39;s need to know and     experience undisturbed area of wilderness. And not all the fact are  in on the studies of the ecological relationships to be found in Long  Canyon. There is a great deal of life in Long Canyon and in four  and five. And I don&#39;t believe that we choose just the larger mammals and preditors that you can say that there&#39;s no wildlife there.  So my viewpoint is that we should keep Long Canyon for the  future, study it, and enjoy it and broaden our economic base in  North Idaho. Thank you.",Thank you.

And so to maintain it as a  monitoring tool for the whole Selkirk Crest, we should leave Long  Canyon roadless so that we can tell overall what its impact on multiple use is having on, say, fisheries, spawning beds, et cetera.  Canyon Creek or Long Canyon is an excellent monitoring tool in  that it isâ€”its length and in the elevation, you&#39;ve got steep slopes.  And down toward the bottom of the creek, you&#39;ve got more of a  U-shape. Parker Creek is mostly just steep. And Myrtle Creek has  more of a U-shape so you get the overall view.  And the Forest Service says in monitoring the water quality in  Canyon Creek already as opposed to Smith Creek, which is just  north of the drainage, just to see the water quality and the comparisons.

My wife and I own about 14 acres in the Naples area which we operate organically. And that produces our food for the year.  I favor a wilderness classification for Long Canyon for a number  of reasons which are economic, social, and esthetic. But it&#39;s come to  my attention that problems of a wilderness classification for Long  Canyon argue that in a wilderness, disease and pest outbreaks  cannot be adequately controlled due to the lack of roads in the  area and that such outbreaks can be a threat to adjacent timber  lands. This argument has already been addressed in the Wilderness  Act which gives the Secretary of Interior wide latitude to deal with  such natural disasters. In section 4, it says:  353  Such measures may be taken as may be necessary in the control of fire, insects,  and disease subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems desirable. Aircraft,  motorized equipment, and temporary roads may all be used although the Federal  agencies use the minimum necessary tool first.  Long Canyon is surrounded by roads which make containing pest  and disease outbreaks sufficient and economical. But it is retaining  Long Canyon as a wilderness that the greatest benefits in disease  and pest control for the timber industry may be found. Long  Canyon provides a source of genetically resistant timber varieties  to disease and pest degradation.  Disease and pest infestation follows the cycles that are beyond  man&#39;s control. The most that can be hoped for is to make use of the  dying timber. But disease, insects, and death are part of the forest  ecosystem. By maintaining Long Canyon as a wilderness, we can be  assured of a living laboratory for the study of disease and pest  cycles.","Thank you very much.

I have worked in and  spent a great deal of my leisure time in every roaded canyon on  the west side of Boundary County and the northern part of Bonner  County.  It has been my experience in every one of these drainages that  just a few minutes walking time in nearly any direction you can  find peace and quiet and obtain the feeling of aloneness, which I  value very much.  I have been in Long Canyon on several occasions, the first being  in 1949. At that time you could catch 50 fish in a half hour easily.  The last time I was there, I fished for 4 hours and caught only  eight fish, and I saw more sign of man&#39;s presence that I have in  many areas of the roaded canyons.  I had the experience of operating a bulldozer for 24 days on the  Trapper Peak fire in 1967. It was a horrible thing to see and to be  involved in. It started at the head of the Cow Creek drainage, and  there was no road in Cow Creek. I worked with my cat and others  for 3 days building an access road to the fire. By the time we  reached the fire, it had covered more than 2,000 acres. Had we  been able to get to the fire the first day, it could have well made a  big difference in the outcome. But because it had such a start, it     burned over 16,000 acres, and is not a very pretty sight today.  I have spent many hours walking a large portion on the Selkirk  Crest. It is a beautiful area, and because of the topography and the  low timber value, it sould and will remain nearly as it is today.

My proposal is economic in nature. I simply propose to sell these  wilderness areas to the wilderness societies. This, in my opinion,  would have numerous benefits. One, provide considerable income to  the Federal Government. Two, eliminate considerable management  costs to the Federal Government. These I estiamte to be about  $5,680,000 annually. Three, provide significant property tax income  to the local government, which I estimate to be $160,000 annually.  This amount is not insignificant to a county that recently rejected  a school bond levy, a county where 70 percent of the land is owned  by the State and Federal governments, and where 50,000 acres are  now set aside for primitive recreation and birds. That leaves a  pretty small few of us to support the local government via property  taxes. Four, this would give the wilderness societies management  antonomy to love and use as they see fit. However, I&#39;m not sure  how OSHA would treat the grizzly bears.     How would they finance this particular venture? Well, they  could solicit funds as they now do for lobbying. Or they could establish user fees which I estimate might be in the neighborhood of  $29,000 to $30,000 per user.  This whole proposal, you say, is preposterous. But in economic  jargon, &#39;There ain&#39;t no free lunchâ€”just economic insanity,&#39; or  maybe insane economists.

Additionally, Boulder Creek, Borah Peak, and Little Wood River are strong can didates for legal challenges if the surrounding areas become wilder ness.  For example, Little Wood River provides winter range for 300 to It is part of the Elk Mountain crucial elk range and an area of critical environmental concern. Secretary Watt dropped this unit from wilderness consideration be cause it is smaller than 5,000 acres. It is about 4,400 acres. This is 400 elk and year-round deer range.  absurd. It is an integral part of our ecosystem. There are no mining claims, and the existing moderate sheep grazing would be protected under wilderness. The highest and best use of Idaho&#39;s wilderness is wilderness. Ask the packers and guides, the sportsmen, the conservationists, the tourists, the people who benefit from the clean watersheds that don&#39;t slide into town every spring. Outdoor recreation is Idaho&#39;s second largest industry. It has remained healthy during this long     534  recession when the sawmills and the mines, and the smelters have shut down for months or even years at a time. One of my employees recently ran into old friends from Oregon who were logging on the Boise River. When she asked them why they were working in Idaho, they replied, &#39;Because there aren&#39;t any forests left in Oregon.&#39; What do we do after we log the last Idaho forest? It is time we faced reality. The forest products of to morrow will come off the tree plantations of today. It is time to re plant and properly manage the millions of acres of unreseeded forest land already exploited in Idaho, not chase after some last pie-in-the-sky bonanza. I strongly urge that Corral Horse Basin, Jerry Peak West, Jerry Peak, and Boulder Creek be included in any White Clouds-Boulder wilderness. This is vital to protect the lowland crucial winter range which is essential to the total Boulder- White Clouds ecosystem. I personally urge that Mallard-Larkin, Great Burn-Cayuse Creek, and Grandmother Mountain would be my top wilderness sugges tion for Idaho; my comments explain why",,RANDALL E.

Aug-09-1983,aug-09-1983-feldman-murray,,Moscow (CITY);Bighorn Weitas (WILDERNESS),"Feldman, Murray",,Moscow,"Moscow, Idaho",m,"Mr. Feldman. Good afternoon. My name is Murray Feldman and I&#39;m a resident of Moscow, Idaho, where I&#39;m a graduate student and research assistant in the College of Forestry at the University of  Idaho. Contrary to Senator McClure&#39;s statements, the roadless areas dis cussed today have not been studied extensively and in detail. The same Federal court decision that has prompted these hearings noted that the Forest Service&#39;s evaluation of these areas lacked enough sight specific detail to satisfy national environmental policy requirements. The court also pointed out that the Forest Service&#39;s assessment was rushed and inadequate. I fail to see why we should fall into the  414  in Idaho with a hurried, put-together wilderness proposal. Instead I encourage Senator McClure and the rest of the Idaho congressional delegation to take the lead in sound environmental decisionmaking and to attempt to do a proper job of studying and evaluating these roadless areas, instead of once again coming to the rescue of the Forest Service after they have failed to fulfill the legislative mandates. As for the future management of Idaho&#39;s roadless areas, I would suggest that instead of building roads in the undeveloped areas, that this money be spent on more intensive, and hense productive, management of already roaded areas. In fact, a recent study by the Wilderness Society in the BighornWeitas roadless area in Idaho, found that, and I quote, &#39;It is finan cially more attractive to postpone timber sales on many sites and concentrate instead on harvesting from highly productive sites which are unlikely to be found in roadless areas.&#39; Finally, roadless lands not designated as wilderness should not be released for immediate multiuse management. This decision would only serve to short circuit the environmental impact stated process by never considering the wilderness values foregone by de veloping these areas. In addition, these areas would then be subject to a national forest managing act planning process, which is heavily biased toward timber production, effectively insuring that these lands will not be available for future wilderness consideration. What&#39;s needed here today is not simply a rehash of the wilder ness versus development argument, but rather a search for new and innovative solutions to today&#39;s land use problems that will pro vide the benefits we seek while protecting the environment from further needless degradation. The natural heritage and resources of these Idaho roadless areas demand nothing less than our full effort toward this end. Thank     same trap here  you.",Thank you.

Those  areas not designated wilderness should be managed by normal  forest planning, processing, and later, if necessary, reevaluated for  their best usage.     The areas in the Panhandle that should be protected are Long  Canyon, Salmo Priest, and the Selkirk Crest.  As for Salmo Priest, the same mature lumber that they&#39;re talking about dragging out is also the main principal diet for the endangered caribou. It&#39;s on these trees that the moss grows that they  mix up the majority of their diet. And I believe that this herd is  more important than the value that would be brought about from  the timber.

My name is Linda Sanders. I was born and raised  in this fine State of Idaho. I grew up in Kellogg, 35 miles east of  381  Coeur d'Alene. I&#39;ve seen personally what exploitation of resources  without regard to its environmental impact can do to an area.  In the late 1800&#39;s, the hills around Kellogg-Wardner area were  demuted for housing, mining, and wood products. Then as mining  operations expanded, pollution from the smelter prevented natural  regrowth of vegetation and trees.  The mills immediately surrounding the area have been there for  as long as I can recall. This may be the origin for my deep feelings  for exploring environmentalism.  My fist major point is that I endorse the Idaho Conservation  League Wilderness Core. Also, I strongly oppose hard release language. I support the use of soft languageâ€”release language regarding the wilderness bill because furture generations have a right to  consider these matters in the future. I believe it is selfish for us to  think that we have the right to the final say so.  Also, I support maximum wilderness for Idaho. I wish to emphasize three specific areas: Long Canyon, Selkirk Crest, and MallardLarkins. I have had the pleasure of backpacking into those areas  this summer. The natural beauty of the pristine and forest in Long  Canyon was breathtaking. I marveled at the green mountain country of the forest floor. It was natural and peaceful. I felt renewed  and inspired. I don&#39;t want it to be destroyed or altered even slightly by road building and logging operations. I would like to have it  remain in its natural state.","Thank you very much.

Ms. Sanders. Thank you.

The Chairman. Mr. Hilding, we have one of the witnesses here

today, Mr. Parsons, indicated that Foehl&#39;s Creek is close to hem-

lock timber. Is that correct?

Mr. Hilding. Well, I&#39;ve traveled up and down Foehl&#39;s Creek. And

on the top edge of the Foehl&#39;s Creek on that side of the drainage,

most up into Foehl Creek is some of the finest white pine on the St.

Joe.

Mr. Parsons. That&#39;s a lot of wild hemlock.

Ms. Hilding. That&#39;s OK because we&#39;re ready to make a sale

there. We&#39;ve made a sale on Lodge Creek. You know where that is.

And we&#39;re looking into it. And if you want to take a look at the

fine white pine that is dying out there, you can take a look at it.

And some of it you&#39;ll find it s 3 feet through and lots of volume of

it.

The Chairman. Do you agree, Mr. Parsons?

Mr. Parsons. Well, there is some fine white pine. I can&#39;t argue

with the man. But there&#39;s an awful lot of hemlock, too. And I can&#39;t

justify a road going in to get the pine that&#39;s there with the hem-

lock that&#39;s in there.

Mr. Hilding. Well, there&#39;s other species there, too. There&#39;s hem-

lock there, too, of course. It&#39;s there in all stands. And I don&#39;t know

what kind of hemlock you&#39;re talking about. But this western hem-

lock is suitable for pulpwood and removed. If it&#39;s mountain hem-

lock, which I don&#39;t think it is because it&#39;s not high enough, it isn&#39;t

worth removing.

Statewide I support the Endangered Wilderness Core as proposed  by the Idaho conservation groups. And in the northern part of the  State specifically, I support designation of wilderness for Mallard-  Larkins, at least 2,000 acres and not the cut in half designated wil-  derness as proposed by the timber industry.  I support a Great Burn wilderness which would include the  RARE n recommended acres, plus the entire Kelly Creek-Cayuse  Creek drainage, which has been spoken of often already. In addi-  tion, I support the RARE II wilderness recommendations for Moose  Mountain. Further north I support the wilderness recommendation  for Grandmother Mountain east of Clarkia. This is an area that is  half BLM Forest Service acreage.  And, of course, I support a wilderness for the Selkirks, the Long  Canyons, for the Salmo-Priest area and for Scotchman&#39;s Peak. My  detailed reasons for support are in my written testimony.     Speaking of release, I oppose hard release language. If any non-  roadedâ€”nonwilderness areas remain 20 years from now, there&#39;s  probably going to have to be a great reason for it. And we should  not remove the possibility of further wilderness consideration for  those areas if they by chance still exist 20 years from now.","They will be. Are they attached to your state-

Senator McClure, I&#39;m from Moscow, Idaho, not Orofino as it says in the agenda.  As a taxpayer and business person in the State of Idaho, I would  like to say that on an economic basis I object to proposed roadbuildings in certain areas, specifically the Jersey Jack, Mallard Creek  area having seen a map of proposed roads and the network of those  primary roads built at huge taxpayer expense or as has been mentioned before basically a $4Vfe million deficit when the timber is  harvested. Along with that proposal for the White Water River  Road being widened and expanded, I have known that road to deliver Cadillacs down to the Salmon River as it exists now and see  really no reason for it to be expanded any more.  As a citizen who uses wilderness and the great lands of Idaho  from a study point of view, I support more wilderness in the State  of Idaho as proposed by the Idaho Conservation Council and so on  with the Endangered Wild Core and just wanted to say that I think  the timber industry needs to better manage its own lands to utilize  private lands that exist in better managing those lands and to     create their resources from those existing lands rather than utilizing perhaps marginally producing lands that are currently under  consideration.

Yes, thank you. I&#39;m Robert Small from Moscow. And  I came from the midwest a year ago.

But I think there&#39;s other jobs available to them also. I think thatâ€”  well, I was talking to a ranger on the Red River District, Bill  Hayes. And he said that most of the old logging roads that were  built still contributed considerable amounts of silt and sedimentation in our streams. With those roads could we go backâ€”we could  go back and fix them.  Also, I think that there should be some work done in the reforestation area. I was up at Black Lake in the Mallard-Larkins area  and looked across at Scull Creek and noticed extensive clear-cutting. I talked to the man who was running the lookout up on Black  Mountain. He said they wereâ€”most of those were cut in the late  sixty&#39;s. And they tried to replant them three or four times and  they just didn&#39;t take. Also, I&#39;ve seen some of the damage that has  occurred up by Elk Summit. And some irresponsible logging, I  guess would be the best way to put it. It&#39;s phenomenal the things  that go on as far as being detrimental to our fish an wildlife qualities and the aesthetic value of our wilderness. I think that if we  preserve wilderness, we will be a lot better off in the long run because we&#39;ll be attracting the tourist dollar and also attracting  many people who are in higher industries out here and just for the  recreational benefits.

There&#39;s been a lot of talk during these meetings about the value  of our trees in board feet. But I also think that there is another  issue that exists in our wilderness. And that&#39;s the wildlife. So I  wanted to share with you some of the information that I found out  about the wildlife and how it is essential to our livelihood. This is  quoted from Norman Myers&#39; &#39;A Wealth of Wild Species.&#39;  Twenty years ago a child with leukemia had one chance in five for survival. Now  his chances are four out of five, due to a new drug extracted from the rosy periwinkle. Sales amount to $100 million a year.  Thank goodness we didn&#39;t slaughter the buffalo. For some strange reason, they  are all cancer free. And from those few remaining herds immunologists may learn  how to prevent the disease in humans.  Likewise, researchers think that the cheetah may provide a keyhole for insights  into coronary and respiratory health. The pupfish, with its high tolerance for saline  water, is throwing light on human kidney failures.  As to industry, woodpeckers are helping to design better crash helmets, beech  trees are cleaning the air of particulate pollution, and in a few years bacteria may  be mining copper.  Yet, the animals on this Earth are thoughtlessly being pushed  into extinction at the rate of at least one species a day. Perhaps     now we can understand the importance of protecting the caribou,  wolves, and grizzlies, along with thousands of other plants and animals that inhabit our forests. Even hardhearted industrialists and  politicians, especially those with kidney or coronary troubles, may  think twice about preserving our wilderness.

My name is Fred Rabe. And I&#39;m from Moscow, Idaho.  Initially, I would like to endorse the wilderness proposals advocated by the Idaho Conservation League. For the past 10 years I  and other biologists throughout the State together with agency  people have been working on the idea of natural areas in Idaho.  Natural areas are small, unaltered sites, such as, small mountain  lakes, meadows, bogs, and small streams which give us certain advantages in terms of using them as baseline study areas. They also  provide educational and recreational opportunities. In fact, a  number of my graduate students in the past 15 years have used  these areas for research sites. They also provide sites of endangered plants and animals, which we especially like to obtain as  unique sites.  What I would especially like to advocate, Senator McClure, is the     protection of Sneakfoot Meadows, which my group and I have  looked at over the years. It&#39;s an area that&#39;s about 3 miles from the  summit of Elk Summit. It&#39;s a large meadow that encloses a  streamâ€”a meandering stream with a moose herd of about 30 to 40  animals. It also contains an endangered cutthroat trout species.  One of the most interesting things also is the endangered species of  plant that exists in Sneakfoot Meadows. This area is unique. I say  unique because of all the areas that we&#39;re studied over the past 10  years in northern Idaho, there&#39;s not really one like it. There are  other meadows granted. But these meadows are roaded or they&#39;re  extremely small meadows in the State. The Forest Service has gone  on record. The USDA Forest Service environmental statement land  planâ€”Elk Summit Planning Unit stated that the Sneakfoot-Marion  Meadows Management Unit should be managed primarily for  summer moose range. Specifically the report says that the unit will  be managed primarily for watershed protection. However, Senator  McClure, their plans have changed in terms of logging operations,  especially in the headwaters of this area. And so I would especially  call your attention to the fact that this areaâ€”this whole general  area should be merged into wilderness protection. If it&#39;s not, I&#39;m  afraid that the upper regions of this meadow will be affected, the  stream will be sedimented and during the logging operations, the  calving that takes place with the moose might be affected in the  future.",,FRED W.

Because of what&#39;s been said earlier today, I&#39;m going  to part from written testimony and try to make a couple points  that haven&#39;t been made. I&#39;m currently an unemployed natural resource planner. I just returned from 15 months in New York State;  and it&#39;s great to be back. One of the first things we did when we  got back was hike around the Mallard-Larkins. And like the gentleman on my right we did run into a lot of elk and wildlife. And it  was nice to know it still existed in Idaho. Without exception, the  people we met in New York and in the eastâ€”people that had visited Idaho and the west did so because of the wilderness areas that  Idaho has. They came here not to go to the wilderness but because  the wilderness is something that attracted them. They spent money  in nonwilderness areas. They spent money doing recreation related  to wilderness. And they left having had a good time. It has been a  pleasure to live in the east. But it&#39;s also been very frustrating to  try to explain to easterners the concept of public land and the concept of wilderness.     The issue that we are facing today is not one of whether we have  too much wilderness or too little timber or too little money or too  much money or money in the wrong places. Its a question of preservation, and not just the preservation of natural resources but the  preservation of flexibility to manage these lands for the future.  And if you look at the history of the signs of land management,  professional forestry goes back 75, 80 years. Wilderness management goes back to early sixties. Recreation management to the forties or fifties. Now, we&#39;ve made great changes since then. And I  thinkâ€”I like to believe that we&#39;re going to make even greater  changes in signs of forest economy and signs of resource management. And I think roadless status of some kind, be it designated  wilderness or some other kind of legislative protection for these  roadless areas will allow us the flexibility of future demands.

The first area I marveled at was the beautiful Minnesoka Creek drainage. Please leave it in its natural state. Further  along the trail one observation I found to be disturbing was that  mountains had large patches of clearcuts. I&#39;d hate to see any more  timber stripped from the mountains. Besides scarring landscape,  such practices destroy habitat and wildlife.  I want Idaho to be a State to be proud of. The fact that Idaho has     so much wilderness nowâ€”second to Alaskaâ€”is a positive, not a  negative thing. One of the main drawing points to Idaho is its natural beauty, fishing and hunting opportunities. And I feel this is  probably the main drawing point to Idaho. Let&#39;s not exploit it.  American&#39;s need wilderness. It&#39;s been realized in the past. And wilderness is multiple use.  It has been wisely said that, &#39;In wilderness is the preservation of  the world.&#39; And I quote from this month&#39;s National Geographic.

During the Lolo Land Use Plan, Fish Creek was set aside for a  wildlife study area. And the Forest Service and Fish and Game  spent considerable money in there. Put an elk trap in the upper  meadows where there is a mineral lick where the elk eat the minerals out of the ground to get those nutrients that they need. And  they also set cameras on Elk Butte to take pictures of the game  there. And I feel it&#39;s a very important area for the fisheries. It&#39;s a  good steelhead fishery as well as west slope cutthroat trout.  The other partâ€”there&#39;s a Fish Creek side and then there&#39;s what  they called a Hungery Creek. Now, when I was a boy, we called it  Obia Creek. And the Forest Service changed the name of Obia  Creek because they figured out that that&#39;s where Lewis and Clark  just about started at going through there too early in the summer  when there&#39;s still snow on that high country and on the Old Indian  638  Lolo Trail. That the longest stretch of the Lolo Trail is still primitive. It&#39;s an 18-mile stretch. And it borders Hungery Creek.

there. The Forest Service doesn&#39;t say it&#39;s our cabin. They say it&#39;s

theirs because we don&#39;t have a business back there anymore. They

went in a few years ago and chopped the door off my grandma&#39;s

cabin and hauled all her stuff out of there. And we just went and

built a new door and moved back in because we built itâ€”well, my

family built it. And the Forest Service hasn&#39;t got a nickel in the

place.

But Eldorado Creek, I think, should be included with the Fish

Creek drainage because the only thingâ€”with the Fish Creek road-

less area because the only thing that divides the two is the High-




line Road which is just the old Forest Lolo Motorway Road. It&#39;s aâ€”

you know, just a narrow, dirt road. And that&#39;s a RARE II Area 1-

312. And like I said, the Lolo Trail runs through that area. And I

think it&#39;s very important that there be preserved the lower part of

Lolo Creek cuts off into Cedar Creek. And that&#39;s where the Clark

tree stands. That&#39;s when the Lewis and Clark Expedition went

through there, Clark, you know, carved his initials in this tree that

still stands in there. And so I think that&#39;s very important that that

area should be set aside and looked at as an addition to the Nation-

al Scenic Trail system.

I would hope that you look at it very carefully- indeed look at each  individual area in regard to its uniqueness, resources, and wilderness  potential.  Some areas have only marginal timber resources, but yet are rich in  wildlife. Such is the case in the GREAT BURN-CAYTJSE CREEK area. The  existence of a &#39;blue-ribbon&#39; trout stream, Kelly Creek, indicates the  importance of this area. Other areas are the home of endangered species.  The LONG CANYON-SELKIRK CREST and the SALMO PRIEST areas have populations  of grizzly bear and caribou. The MALLARD LARKINS and GREAT BURN also  support grizzly bear and gray wolves. These endangered species represent  a special problem in that their management (by law) precludes many forest  activities, and this at the very least limits the timber harvest potential.  Indeed, in the case of the caribou( woodland and mountain) very little reliable  research has been conducted to date. We really do not know the best management  practices for these animals.  All of this seems to contradict the notion that we must decide once and  for all which lands are to be wilderness. This fails to leave room for any  future decisions on behalf of the Forest Service as to management. Closing  future options is indeed bad management.  I have failed to elaborate on many areas in central and southern Idaho  which deserve special attention in regard to wilderness designation. Suffice     it to say, that in total, a variety of areas will be presented- from alpine  areas, to sagebrush flats, to rain forest as in the SALMO-PRIEST area.  In summary, I am of the opinion that my suggestions are in the best  interest of Idaho and the nation. The sportsmen and conservationists proposal  encompasses a variety of wilderness- quality areas, and each should be  evaluated on its own merits. Thank you.  652  Mr. Chairman.

My opening position is to support the proposed Endangerd Wilderness Core of 10 areas that are cosponsored by the  Idaho Conservation League. I further support a soft-sufficiency language as a fair approach in the future planning and management  of Idaho&#39;s roadless lands.  I have developed a great love and respect for the lands of Idaho.  Our State is particularly special with its vast amount of forest  land. I cannot emphasize the importance of careful planning and  evaluation of these lands. There is a need for further research and  continued comprehensive planning of all forest lands. There is not  a need to rush into a permanent land management plan that has  had no additional studies since the discredited RARE II evaluation  of 1978. A forest is a complex community that should have all aspects evaluated before putting an economic tag on it.  In the past, little public opinion has dictated the goals and management philosophies of the National Forest Service. Changes in  recent times have provided more public input in management decisions that affect public lands. These current public sentiments lie  in a more balanced resource approach as designed by the MultipleUse/Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The recent National Forest Management Act of 1976 acknowledges the Multiple-Use/SustainedYield Act by further providing listed guidelines for land manage   ment planning decisions. They are:  To insure that timber will be harvested from National Forest Service lands only  where:  (1) Soil, slope, or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged;  (2) There is assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within 5 years  after harvest;  (3) Protection is provided for streams, streambanks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands,  and other bodies of water from detrimental changes in water temperatures, blockages of water courses, and deposits of sediment, where harvests are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat; and  (4) The harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give  the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber.  I insist that all Idaho national forests should adhere to this  policy in the event of developing current roadless lands.  I also have included in this report areas of interest that I personally visited to and experienced. Mallard-Larkins, Grandmother  Mountain, Upper Priest Lake, the Selkirk, and other areas of interest that have potential Wilderness recognition would be Scotchman  Peak, Kelly Creek, which would be in the Hoodoo Mountain-Great  Burn Area, Elk Summit and Walton Lakes, both of the concerned  Lochsa Face Area.  Wilderness is significant because it applies to all realms of the  muliple use/sustained-yield concept. And its recreation, range, watershed, wildlife, and fish with the exception of timber. This is an  enduring resource thatâ€”wilderness is an enduring resource that  allows natural selection and succession to follow its own course.  658  The demand and use of wilderness is ever increasing. And I believe  Idaho should lead the way as a wilderness enriched State. Present  and future generations would greatly benefit by its social and economic welfare.

Thank you. I want to talk about the Kelly Creek  area of the proposed wilderness. And I would like to say, first of  all, that I was there just a week ago today. And some of the things  that I saw, were, first of all, the roads that we traveled on. And the  roadsâ€”one of the main roads we were on was a CCC road that we  estimate was built maybe 50 years ago. And probably one of the  first things we noticed was that it is unstable even now in many  spots. That is to say, that we saw a slumpâ€”a major slump area  that is still emptying itself into Kelly Creek. And we noticed, also,  that it&#39;s been surveyed for widening which indicated to us that it  was going to be causing more slumps and more damage to the  Kelly Creek watershed.  The soil of the area was fragile, fine soils of the Idaho Batholith.  Especially the area that was unstable, we noticed, was the fine micaceous soil which was almost like sand. And it was obvious to us  that it was not going to hold up during the sort of use or any further roadbuilding. And we felt that any further roadbuilding in  that area would directly contribute to the degradation of Kelly  Creek and to its tributaries.  673  We also saw and fished in the Cayuse and Kelly Creeks. And we  noticed that the water quality was excellent at this time. It was  beautiful. You could see all the way to the bottom every place. It  was totally unsilted. And one of the other things that you might be  interested in knowing about was that there were people from all  over the State fishing there. We saw license plates from everywhere. So it&#39;s not something that&#39;s just used locally. But it&#39;s something that&#39;s used by many people in the State. And in comparing it  to some other areas that have been logged right near Kelly Creek  we noticed that the Orogrande Creek, which has apparently been  logged recentlyâ€”it was a smaller creek. And it was dirtier. It was  full of silt and mud. There wereâ€”whoever had logged it had logged  all the way down to the creek. And the cull logs were still lying in  the creek. And it was obvious that this would cause problems in  the future. The fishâ€”fishâ€”there wouldn&#39;t be a variance of fish  that would cause the water temperature to change and that sort of  thing.  So if that was an example of logging practices in the area, I can  guarantee you that you would ruin Kelly Creek and Cayuse Creek  and Toboggan Creek. You would ruin all the fish in those areas if  this is the type of logging that&#39;s been proposed.  And, also, we noticed that there was no erosion control whatsoever in the area that had been logged, again, on the Orogrande  Creek.     The timber itselfâ€”we went all the way up Toboggan Ridge Road.  And we noticed that the timber was something like 4 to 6 inches in  diameter. Mostly lodgepole pine. And as we went up higher in the  elevation, the trees were smaller. And there were, of course, fewer  of them. Also, we saw many more meadows as we went higher up.  So the timber itselfâ€”the timber resources are not that great.","Thank you very much. Appreciate your testimo-

Yes. Senator McClure, I&#39;m Peter Gray. And I&#39;m from  Moscow, Idaho. And as and Idahoan, I am very proud of our wilderness heritage. Even though Idaho has the most designated wilderness land of any State except Alaska, it is still small compared to  the forested lands used for other purposes.  Americans need wilderness to preserve species whose habitats  have been greatly reduced by the inroads of man and to provide a  sample to ourselves and to future generations of what our continent was like prior to settling.  I support the inclusion of the 10 core areas as endorsed by Idaho  conservation groups. I oppose the hard release language for the  Idaho Wilderness Bill. Future generations should be free to designate additional wilderness lands if they choose to do so. I am opposed to subsidized logging roads and deficit timber sales. Why  should the taxpayers have to pay for roadbuilding which exceeds  the value of timber in the area? Roadbuilding in many areas results in silting of streams and destruction of fisheries. The Idaho  batholith soil is particularly subject to erosion when disturbed by  roadbuilding operations. This is of particular importance when one  considers that Idaho has some of the best sport fishing streams in  the world.  One area I&#39;d like to focus on right now is the Mallard-Larkins     area. And the Mallard-Larkins is a truly spectacular area replete  with numerous high mountain cirque-basin lakes and ridges connected by several trails. This area should be expanded to include  the canyon of Minnesahka Creek, the Little North Fork of the  Clearwater, Five Lakes Butte, Collins Creek, the Pete Ott-Elizabeth  Lakes complex and the Heritage Cedar Grove, which is a small  stand of virgin western red cedar that escaped the 1910 fire. And I  oppose any attempts to divide this area in half with logging roads  and timber sales.  I urge you, Senator, please do not make any hasty decisions that  provide a quick, short-term profit that will prove ruinous in the  long run. Many other areas are now being managed to insure a  continuous, cost-effective timber supply. It is much easier for the  next generation to remove a land from wilderness out of stump  ranches and rivers of mud.

My name is Ed Krumpe. And I do appreciate the  time and effort that you and your staff have taken to collect public  testimony prior to formulating legislation for additional wilderness  in this great State.  Let me say that I endorse as a minimum the Idaho Conservation  League recommendation for endangered wilderness core areas. But  I support this recommendation because I believe wilderness is a  truly valuable, if little understood, natural resource.  715  Of course, a resource is defined as something that has value and  is useful to mankind. And I believe that wilderness does, indeed, fit  that description. We see evidence of this almost daily.  Perhaps more so than in any other state I&#39;ve lived in are the  residents of this State proud to be from Idaho. And what&#39;s the basis  of this pride? It seems like time after time people talk about and  mention the rich blessing of natural resources. The scenic beauty,  clear flowing streams and rivers, our porous and rugged mountains, all of which serve as a backdrop to our rich farmland and  rangeland and prosperous communities. But not only do the citizens of Idaho recognize this high quality of our natural resources, I  believe that people from all over America are attracted by its  beauty. It&#39;s tourism continues to grow and increase in America and  in Idaho and becomes a leading industry, our resource base will  become even more valuable.  But it&#39;s also this resource base that helps give Idaho the reputation of a great place to live. This fact becomes increasingly important to our State economy as industry seeks places to locate and to  grow. So we must keep in mind that one of the keys to this attractiveness is the quality and naturalness of our forests and mountains and streams. This quality of the natural resources, protected  and perpetuated, is perhaps no better than in designated wilderness areas.  Now, it&#39;s true that Idaho has a large core of wilderness second     only to Alaska. And these areas have served well in providing pure  waters for wild salmon and trout and extinct habitat for big game  as well as a place for people to recreate. But we need to have such  high quality natural resource areas spread throughout the State  from the Salmo Priest and Selkirk Crest area in the north to the  Mallard-Larkins and Great Burn, French Creek and Lake Creek  areas further down to the White Cloud, Boulder Peak, and Palisades in the south. I think that protection should be granted to  show that there is a wide distribution of wilderness allowed to  remain in its natural state.  In conclusion, I recognize that we must provide for the intensive  management and utilization of our natural resources if we are to  supply the needs of industry in a healthy economy. This is as it  should be. With proper care and management, our forest and  rangelands should be productive for years to come. But interspersed throughout these harvest-oriented lands should be a system  of areas where the quality of the resources is protected by its very  naturalâ€”protected by wilderness designation. Thank you.","Thank you. Thank you very much. I only have a

couple of questions.

Mr. Pinkham, an earlier witness made note of the fact that as a

logger, he had purchased timber sales from the Nez Perce Tribe.

And I note in your testimony you&#39;ve suggested that no resource de-

velopment should take place until its impact upon anadromous

fisheries has been evaluated. Would I be correct in assuming that

the Nez Perce Tribe has made that evaluation before making any

sales of timber resources?

Mr. Pinkham. Yes, we have. We have a bilogical staff that&#39;s hea-

dered by Mr. Jim Johnson. And he hasâ€”and we have been doing a

716

survey within reservation boundaries as it exists now. And he is

evaluating, you know, that situation.

You know, the policy of the Nez Perce Tribe is to develop our

resources in a controlled manner so that the impact upon our natu-

ral resources is notâ€”you know, duly does not affect it adversely as

much as possible.

The Chairman. But it&#39;s not a nondevelopment policy.

Mr. Pinkham. No. But we do have resources that we do develop.

But some of this area that we&#39;re talking about here today is outside

of ourâ€”of our boundary now that exists. But then the areas that

have been spoken to today is within the 55 seed area and some of

our aboriginal areas. And we are very concerned about some of

those areas that contribute to anadromous fisheries.

The Chairman. Thank you very much. Mr. Hoge and Mr. Wal-

lace both made reference to the Kelly Creek and Cayuse Creek.

Various people have suggested that that be included in a wilder-

ness area. I would gather from your testimony, although you did

not say that, that was your intention, also.

Mr. Hoge. Yes, sir.

The Chairman. Is that correct?

Mr. Hoge. Yes, sir.

The Chairman. Do you advocate closing the road?

Mr. Hoge. No, I advocate leaving them just like they are.

Thank you, Senator. I&#39;ve come to testify today because I&#39;m concerned, I guess, that in the current economicâ€”I&#39;m  concerned that in the current economic climate and given the  recent hard times in timber and mining that decisions regarding  Idaho&#39;s roadless areas will be unduly influenced by these economic  factors and that the long term and less easily measured benefits of  a large and diverse Idaho wilderness system will be lost in the discussion of the number of jobs to be won by opening these lands to  multiple use management.  I realize at the same time that some lands currently protected by  RARE II need to be opened to development and that this development is important and even crucial to Idaho&#39;s future economic  health. But I feel strongly that the solutions to Idaho&#39;s wilderness  717  question now being proposed by both the Idaho Forest Industry  Council and the Forest Service itself are too restrictive and ultimately shortsighted in their approach. I am also concerned that a  hurried solution to the wilderness question nowâ€”before many of  these areas have been adequately studiedâ€”will lead to the irreversible loss of wild lands, a loss that is neither necessary nor economically justified.  I would like to comment more specifically upon the proposed  Mallard-Larkins wilderness for it is this area that I am most familiar with and one that I especially prize as a valuable recreational  resource for Idaho.  I support the establishment of a Mallard-Larkins Wilderness of  approximately 200,000 acres; that is, an area one third again larger  than 156,000 acres proposed by the Forest Service and nearly four  times larger than the area foreseen in the Industry Council proposal. I am convinced that the larger area is needed in order to preserve the natural integrity of the area and to provide for its effective management as wilderness.  It is particularly important that the Minnesaka Creek drainage  and the Little North Fork Canyon to the west and the Canyon  Creek drainage to the north be included in the wilderness system.  These areas are best managed if they are left in their present  primitive state. It is hard for me to imagine, for instance, how the  steep slopes of the Minnesaka Creek drainage could possibly be     logged without seriously compromising the quality of the watershed and effectively destroying an important fall habitat for elk.  Certainly the logging practices use nearby Smith Ridgeâ€”immediately to the west of the present pioneer areaâ€”do not inspire confidence that the area can be logged without major and irreversible  damage to the delicate ecological system. To the north, the Canyon  Creek drainage has been rated by the Idaho Fish and Game Department as one of the best roadless areas for elk in the northern  part of the State while the canyon of the Little North Fork represents one of the most beautiful wild river canyons in Idaho.  In my view, the long-term benefits to water quality, fish and  wildlife populations, and to recreation far outweigh the short-lived  economic benefit to be gained by harvesting timber in these specific regions. I strongly urge the committee, therfore, to consider the  inclusion of these important areas in the proposed Mallard-Larkins  Wilderness. Thank you.",Thank you very much. Mr. Bill Voxman.,JAMES R.

Bill Voxman from Moscow, Idaho, representing  only myself. And I hope that the views will be shared by others as  well.  In these deliberations I believe it essential that the wilderness  question be viewed from the proper perspective. It seems to me  that the basic question to be resolved is not how much wilderness  is to be gained, but rather how much wilderness we can afford to  lose. As you know, most of the roadless areas currently being studied for wilderness classification are presently, in fact, wilderness  areas, though they lack formal classification as such. Any plan re718  suiting from these hearings can only diminish the amount of wilderness we now enjoy in Idaho. The real question then is, to what  extent should these areas be decreased. I suspect that even many of  those who feel that no more wilderness is desirable base this view  on their satisfaction with the status quo and do not fully realize  that many of the areas which they now perceive as wilderness will  no longer be so.  I am certainly not in favor of locking up even a major portion of  our forests from development. Indeed, as a State employee, my job  and salary are largely dependent on the economy of the State,  which in turn is obviously influenced by the health of the timber  industry. Clearly, an appropriate balance between the needs of the  timber industry and the advantages to be derived from wilderness  areas must be achieved.  In trying to determine this balance it is essential that we do not  lose sight of Idaho&#39;s unique situation. Our lakes, streams, and forests are among the most magnificent to be found in the United  States. But these resources are finite, a concept with which most  Americans have difficulty. And the number of people who wish to  take advantage of them is steadily increasing. It is easy enough to  create people, but it is impossible to create a new Mud Lake, a new  Kelly Creek, new giant cedar groves, and new untouched game  habitat. Thus, the best we can do for ourselves and succeeding generations is to protect this State&#39;s unique heritage, even if this     means, and I doubt that it does, a more modest living standard for  some of us. What may seem to be adequate now may not appear to  be so in the future.  I make no pretext of being an economist, but I would not be surprised that any short-term loss of revenue to the timber industry  resulting from the classification of additional areas as wilderness  would be more than offset over the long run by increased economic  gains in sectors tied to tourism and recreation. Consequently, if we  are far-sighted and careful, we can, in some sense, be in the enviable position of having our cakeâ€”our natural heritageâ€”and eating  it, tooâ€”economic gains derived from this heritage.  I certainly am not familiar with all of the regions that are being  considered for wilderness classification. The two with which I am  most familiar are the Mallard-Larkins and the Kelly Creek regions.  Regions that have already been clearly discussed. I would second  what the previous speaker has just said as far as the Minnesaka  and Canyon Creek drainaged of the Mallard-Larkins area as well  as the Little North Fork. In regard to Kelly and Cayuse Creeks, we  should do whatever we can to protect the rather remarkable area  that that is now.  Specifically, I would suggest that somewhere in the neighborhood  of 200,000 acres be designated as wilderness in the Mallard-Larkins  area; this should include the Minnesaka and Canyon creek drainages as well as the canyon of the Little North Fork.  In regard to the region emcompassing Kelly and Cayuse Creeks,  I would suggest that some 50,000 acres be added to the RARE II  recommendation for the Great Burn Wilderness Area. These additional acres would serve primarily to protect Kelly and Cayuse  Creeks from any damage to the remarkable and nationally recognized quality of these streams. This area is also a prime habitat for  719  such endangered species as the wolf and grizzly. I might mention  that just 2 weeks ago friends of mine from Iowa, of all places, came  to visit me primarily for the purpose of being able to fish Kelly and  Cayuse Creeksâ€”these friends spent no little amount of money  while here in Idaho. In spite of my lack of economic expertise, I  would still venture to suggest that the economic benefits gained by  protecting Kelly and Cayuse Creeks will exceed any short-term  gains from logging these areas, especially in light of the relatively  low timber values in this region.  In areas that are deemed suitable for development I would urge  that increased emphasis be given to finding innovative ways of  road construction and logging so as to minimize environmental  damage, and so that these areas can indeed serve a multiple-use  function. Any costs resulting from the utilization of careful logging  practices are certainly justified by the varied benefits from having  done so.  Finally, I realize, Senator, that you are very much in favor of deciding the wilderness issue now, once and for all. Would it be possible for you to reconsider this objective? Through the years I have  observed that you have the rather rare, but admirable, capacity of  being able to listen to others and subsequently change your views,  and I hope that this might be the case in this instance. I feel  uneasy that final decisions made now might not be in our longterm interests, especially since at this time it is almost impossible     to determine what these long-term interests are. Times change,  ideas change, circumstances change. Therefore, would it not be  more prudent to attempt to arrive at a sound decision now on what  to do with enough of the lands in question so as to reasonably  lessen the incertainties of the timber industry, and yet leave to the  process of time and further consideration decisions on areas for  which either data is incomplete or for which we cannot now fairly  determine what the future should be. Surely we should leave some  of the flexibility and options that we currently have to those that  follow us. Many of the trees have been and will be present for hundreds of years; this should give some slight perspective on the timeframe we might use to decide their fate.",Thank you very much.

I&#39;m a small businessman in  Moscow. One of America&#39;s greatest resources is our wilderness.  Idaho is blessed with an abundance of this resource which is a  reason and great privilege to live here. Where virgin wilderness is  a fantasy in many parts of the world, it is still a reality here in  Idaho.  People visit America to see this wilderness, bear, moose, big horn  sheep roaming freely, eagles soaring in the sky. We must at all  costs preserve this American heritage. Wilderness is a part of our  Nation&#39;s past history. Please help it to be a part of our Nation&#39;s  future.  Of the 6.5 million roadless acres in Idaho&#39;s national forests, there     are areas of uncommon beauty and of unique recreational value.

Hello, I&#39;m Kally Thurman. I&#39;m a small businesswoman in Moscow, Idaho. I developed a minimall on Main Street  in Moscow. It houses seven small businesses, two of my own. I&#39;m  here to address you today eye to eye because I&#39;m real interested in  Idaho remaining Idaho.  The wilderness experience is something that I believe is a ground  note to small business in Idaho. The outfitters, the people who  create toursâ€”there is a whole ground noteâ€”a whole beginning to a  whole new economy. Small business is real difficult in America  today. And if you want to live in a real nice place and not get rich     but survive, the answer is in small business. Jokingly I call myself  a pinko capitalist because I create jobs for myself and my friends  and my community. I am committed to building my community.  The way to do that is to keep Idaho Idaho. There are lots of jobs  that can be created out of remainingâ€”out of creating and keeping  sacred wilderness areas in Idaho.  Once you remove the wilderness of Idaho, you also remove the  wilderness experience. When you remove the wilderness experience, you have removed part of our intellect, part of our cultural  history. Our cultural history comes from the wilderness experience,  and Idaho has a wealth of those. New York City has dozens of  dance troops, but they don&#39;t get rid of half of them.  It&#39;s realy important that we keep the wilderness there so that  that experience is there for our children, for our children&#39;s children, for seven generations look forward. There is no remaking of a  wilderness area. That&#39;s real important that we keep it sacred  there. And it&#39;s only a blind area that things that you can go in and  make some quick money on logging that because there&#39;s no remaking it. It&#39;s gone. That is what I&#39;m committed to. Because not only  are you taking away my culture, my Idaho, my experience, but you  are denying the rest of Americaâ€”not only Idahoans, but the rest of  America, knowing what it is to walk on land that no one else has  done before you. That&#39;s real important. And that&#39;s where Idaho&#39;s  next dollar is going to come from.  Today I brought to you a catalog. This is the Nation&#39;s largest  river supply house. It&#39;s a mail order business. Those outside dollars  end up in Idaho pockets. This is my model. And I&#39;m going to build  businesses that do that.  723",Thank you.

In the short time there, we saw an elk herd, mountain  goats, grouse, and eagles. We hiked through three life zones from  Mountain Forest Zone of ancient cedar, fir, and ferns and Devil&#39;s  Club around Isabella Creek through the Subalpine Zone of Bear  Grass and Subalpine Fir around Heart Lake up to the Alpine Zone  of Red Heather and Indian Paintbrush along Goat Ridge. Trails  within this area provide access to many of the mountain lakes over  a 1- to 2-day trip and the more primitive rivers within the area  would require about 2 to 4 days.  The region is not too amenable to logging. There is extensive  road slumping along the Isabella Creek area and the poorly logged  areas around Collins Creek illustrate the difficulties of logging  these areas.

I want to speak initially to address an earlierâ€”Dr.  Cassell from the Lewiston School District, who suggested that the  best way to supportâ€”I think he was suggesting that one of the best     ways to support education in this State was to open up existing  roadless areas to logging. And I would just really caution us in  terms of that attitude. And I&#39;d start by saying that the reason I&#39;ve  continued to live in this area is because of some things that money  can&#39;t buy. And I know I could go elsewhere and earn more money.

And I&#39;m going to limit, now, my remarks to  just a few areas that I&#39;ve personally experienced.  First of all, Upper Priest Lake is an area that my family and I  have gone to since I was a little boy. And some of my earliest  memories are etched there. This last Memorial Day I took the  family in there again. And I was amazed at just how many people  were there. The only hardship I encountered in backpacking with  my youngest son was that there was too many people there. And  Iâ€”which reinforcedâ€”I was dismayed at that and I was also reinforced because I realized that there are an awful lot of people that  are seeking that kind of experience. Now, I would urge you toâ€”to  protect that kind of experience. Specifically in that area and in  other areas throughout the State.  Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest are other areas that I have  visited in the course of the last several years. And from what I understand, Long Canyon is one of the last major canyons in the area  that does not have a logging road carved through it. And in walking through that area, I was amazed. And I asked myself &#39;Who do  740  I have to thank for this?&#39; And I&#39;m not sure who it was, but, indeed,  if you decided to protect it, I would certainly thank you and support you in years to come for doing that.

Thank you. I am an unabashed, chauvinist Idahoan. I have lived here most of my life and I love it. The great part of  loving Idaho for me is having access to wilderness areas. And like  some other people have mentioned, I could make more money  somewhere else. But the quality of life in Idaho is important to me.  Like a lot of other Idahoans, I naively assumed we had enough wilderness areas because there is a lot of beautiful area around for me  to hike and hunt and camp and fish in. So I was really shocked to  find out that we really have no wilderness area in North Idaho.  Nothing north of the Selway. All ofâ€”which to me is the most beautiful part of the State, naturally. All of that is not protected. And it  was really a saddening day to me to hear that they wanted to log  Mallard-Larkins. This area is one of the most beautiful places on  Earth, I think. And it would really be a miserable thing to log it.  The reason some of these areas have never been logged is not because they&#39;re so beautiful but because they&#39;re so inaccessible.  Nobody wants to build a road in there who has to pay for it.  Timber companies want the taxpayers to build a road in because as  Doug Shepherd was saying, most of the timber sales we get for  these lands is much less than it costs the taxpayers to build the  road.     So it&#39;s not economical. It encourages wasteful use of the land.  Eventually, the loggers are telling us they&#39;re going to run out of  timber anyway. So if they&#39;re not going to open the roadless areas,  they&#39;re not going to have logs to cut. Eventually, if we open up the  roadless areas, they&#39;re going to cut all that, too. And then where do  they go? I think they have to learn what the farmers learned about  the dust bowls in the thirties. That you can&#39;t keep taking and  taking and taking from the land without putting something back.  So the answer is not to give them more lands to log but for them  to learn how to replace what they&#39;ve already taken so they can  harvest it again in 60 years.  I also think that we don&#39;t really know enough to say right now  that 1983 is the year that we can decide exactly what we need to  do with all our land. It may turn out that in this galaxy, this is the  only planet with any kind of life on it. And maybe some of the life  forms that we haven&#39;t even cataloged yet in the wilderness area  will turn out to be ones that we can transplant to the moons of Jupiter for food for settlers.  I think we really need to understand the balance before we can  make any hard-and-fast decisions.

Senator McClure, ladies and gentlemen, I am Nelle Tobias, a native Idahoan and a resident of McCall for over 40 years. There I have observed the use and misuse of our national forest lands. Today Idaho ranks immutable as a treasury of extremely differ ent and yet closely interrelated geologic communities of plants and animals, including humans. In addition to forage, timber, and minerals, even more important products from these communities are air and water. Without either one, life ceases. No one has systematically plumbed the potential of other vital products out there. Spot checks have discovered enough to know that the so-called years of study may have covered the obvious, but     little else.  One needs only to fly over the forests to see the extent of brutal clearcuts. Slides onto highways often reflect the removal of cover above by overroading, logging, or grazing. Silted fish spawning beds and plugged reservoirs tell of mismanaged forests. Idaho is my friend. 1 love it. I can do no less than defend it when it is threatened by such attack. I urge the following three measures  of defense: First, close no options to future wilderness protection for any Idaho land.  Second, set-aside large tracts as a permanent wilderness savings account. Roughly, this includes all of the as-yet unroaded areas proposed as alternative W under RARE II. Third, give priority wilderness protection to the following areas now threatened by development. They are Salmon-Payette Crest, Rapid River drainage, and Gospel-hump extension, all in the Payette National Forest and the endangered core areas.

I would like to have a good relationship with the environment, and out of this relationship understand the importance of nature; nature being the whole of man&#39;s natural environment, the planet  earth, the cosmos and whatever exists beyond. These are things I want to be allowed to experience. I believe that the misunderstanding of the importance of nature to the indi vidual is the greatest tragedy of the human race. This tragedy is the undoing of the individual that has created a vacuum for the cancerous and cannibalistic growth of an overly aggressive and overly consumptive nuclear monster. And if not nuclear, then some type of monster that destroys chil dren, families, local stability, love, wisdom, Idaho and the human itself. Yes, I believe this tragedy is a result of people being isolated from the natural environment. The human without a good relationship to the natural environ ment is destroyed and destroys. It is obvious that the destruction of nature is simultaneously paralleling the destruction of humanity. Being human, to me, is an opportunity to experience the ulti mate in life. We have evolved or been given sensitivity, intelligence and opportunities for growth. Through our stimulated senses we are awakened, but without the stimuli our senses become defunct. If one sits in a dark cave without the visible radiation of light, the eyes will become weak and with time probably cease to exist. If one keeps the mind from stimuli, it too ceases to exist. The environment is the stimuli. Without the experience of nature and its rhythms, there is no wisdom. As Luther Standing Bear has stated, Man&#39;s heart away from nature becomes cold and hard. I don&#39;t believe its productive or necessary for me to point out spe cifics dealing with acreages and boundaries. If one does not develop a good direction, then one is making a farce of these proceedings and hearings and burdening the people of Idaho and elsewhere. Keep the genocidal monster and its parasitic tentacles away. We need every handful of our natural environment. I have testified as an individual who feels the expanded impor tance of nature to the whole of our society. However close or de tached you are to nature, I hope you see its importance and join in the spirit that returns to nature what is taken and realize that the less one takes and disturbs of nature, the more one is of its wisdom and spirit.

First of all I wanted to thank you for giving us all this opportunity to testify. We really do appreciate it. And Mr. Craig, I&#39;m fascinated by your interest in creating wil dernesses out of formerly devastated areas. And I suggest maybe that we begin by re-creating or fixing up the Crystal Beach Condo miniums on Payette Lake in McCall for future wilderness area, if you would like someplace to start. Since Idaho is blessed with some of the largest area of roadless land in the country, it&#39;s natural that the State should formally des ignate more wilderness than other States. Mining is important, but it&#39;s not supreme and it is undeniably a short term and rapacious affair. Logging is important, but it&#39;s not the end all use of forest land. Neither is wilderness the best use of all land. But I propose it as the proper use of the following areas, with which I am familiar. And I will refer to the RARE II names where I can. First, French Creek. I believe that all of French Creek drainage should be wilderness along with the areas south â€” excuse me, to Fisher Creek and Granite Lake Reservoir and east to the upper Payette Lake. The western portion of the French Creek area should take in Twin Lakes, Rainbow Lakes, Coffee Cup Lake and the land south to Granite Mountain. In addition, the Little French Creek drainage with or without the proposed timber sale, and I would prefer to have it with in that area, including Elk Meadows. And Upper Hazard Lake should be included. The next area that I would like to address is north, south and east Lick Creek area. The area is a large area east of McCall and contains some of the most impressive and accessible countryside around.  416  The north and south Lick Creek portions are separated from the eastern portion by the dramatic landscape from the Secesh River to the South Fork of the Salmon River. All of this area should be wilderness, including the Needles, and as much of the riparian habitat along the South Fork as is possible, given the road, which parallels the river. Next, the Meadow Creek and Pinnacle Peak area.

Hi, my name is Char Roth. Thanks for the opportuni ty to speak for wilderness. I wish I had the same opportunity to  speak out for pro-choice, but so I was insured that I was listened to, but I will give you a letter about that issue later on. I strongly support the following areas as wilderness in the Payette Crest region: Rapid River, French Creek, Lick Creek North, and South, Gospel Hump and Council Mountain. Each offers positive economic benefits of wilderness and high recreation al values. Although Rapid River and French Creek contain high timber and wilderness values, I question development costs that could exceed timber value due to assessibility and low productivity. Why does wilderness always have to be used for and by people? If we continue to exploit these lands through excessive logging and mining practices, as done in the past 20 years, future generations will not have the freedom to go to wild places. It&#39;s hard to imagine not having a place to go for solitude, that wilderness state of mind. I go to Rapid River every spring to see my favorite wildflowers. I think that we need to protect not only the narrow strip of that river, but also the surrounding beauties, the grassy mountainsides that look like moose and bear paradise, rocky craigs and overhangs where the cliff swallows nest, brilliantly colored wildflower mead ows, and rattlesnake boulder homes. Lick Creek North covers an area east â€” that&#39;s located east of the South Fork of the Salmon and bordered to the east by Secesh River. There are 60 inspirational lakes that can be destroyed by unsta ble soils and erosion from logging, thus degrading fisheries where there are critical spawning beds for salmon. The powerful Secesh River and the Loon Mountains offer prime habitat for big game. I know what wilderness means to me. I think of last week&#39;s back pack trip and know that I really can drink from Big Creek and that we really did see a salmon fight its way upstream to spawn.

I will submit specific recommendations.  549     A strong inventory of wilderness serves to help correct one of the fatal flaws of the human species. That is, that we learn from our  mistakes very poorly, especially because conflicting interests tend to cloud our judgment. The wilderness inventory must be part of the collective memory of humanity just as it is part of the memory of the Earth itself. It is not a potentially replaceable commodity such as commercial timber. I believe it is a crime against humanity and a crime against the Earth to destroy any part of our vanishing racial memory for profit. In the case of the wilderness parcels in question, which I am familiar, there is no visible and compelling reason aside from profit for violating their integrity and, in fact, sanctity. Therefore, I protest and condemn any plan, policy or proposed legislation which would open, for economic reasons, any of the de facto wilderness and roadless area for multiple use. The proposed wilderness bill now being researched by Senator McClure&#39;s commit tee seems like an attempt by industry lobbyists to make available to industry a resource wilderness to which it has no right. This is a vestige of the manifest destiny mentality which is in large part re sponsible for the advanced state of decay of the global environment and the decline of the quality of life in general, and humanity in particular. There will always be times when a decision must be made to choose between the preservation of resources and human needs. There will be times when human needs will take precedence for ap propriate reasons. In this case, the priority is obvious. The shortterm profit loses out to our basic responsibility to protect ourselves, through the protection of the primordial resources of our environ ment, wilderness.",,DAVID SIMMONDS,"McCALL, IDAHO",Simmonds,David,h1d1,"simmonds, david",Earth (PLANET),text

I am going to confine my statement to experience with one of several properties which are involved in the wilderness. This will pertain to the Springfield mine in the Yellow Pine area of Valley County. My first involvement with this was in 1946 as an employee of Bradley Mining Co. at Stibmite. A small but high grade ore body was mined there in the 1950&#39;s producing 6,000 units of tungstic oxide for sale and leaving 12,000 units in the mill tailings which are now part of the mine&#39;s re     serves.  In the 1970&#39;s geophysical work indicated that this outcrop was probably the tip of the iceberg and that drilling and testing was, indeed, a judicious project. Companies who engaged in these expensive projects would not consider going into this one because for 7 years the Forest Service would not allow us to use 4 miles of our road. And then subse quently the wilderness boundary was established to run through the middle of the attractive area. A petition to move the boundary in this area 1 mile farther east drew comments favorable to the petition and a substantial compa ny leased the property. This company&#39;s geologic, geophysical, geochemical, and diamond drilling work in 1982 demonstrated that the mineralized zone was, indeed, extensive and it became apparent that what I had thought was an optimistic request for extension had really been too con servative. I have learned very recently that the petition for the boundary change was rejected. I have also learned from the lessee that the lease will probably be terminated.   The actions by the proponents of the wilderness are depriving our Nation of materials we need for our commerce and our defense. We have too much legislated wilderness now. We, all of the coun try&#39;s citizens, will be better off without any more. We cannot defen sively fight our foes with scenery nor can we feed our children.",,RUSSELL WOOD,"LOWMAN, IDAHO",Wood,Russell,h1d1,"wood, russell",Yellow Pine (CITY); Valley County (COUNTY),text

My name is Craig Gehrke.  I&#39;d like to address my remarks to the Mallard-Larkins area and the  Great Burn proposed wilderness.  I&#39;ve been to these areas. And I know they mostly consist of steep  breaklands and canyons. I&#39;m employed on one of the national forests in Idaho. And part of my job has been to go around and evaluate the tree plantations and to check the seedling establishments.  And I know for a fact if theseâ€”this land is logged, it&#39;s going to be  next to impossible to reestablish any timber on the steep slopes.  Steep slopes represent the most impossible conditions to get trees  going again. Therefore, the cut up there would be one cut. The road  would be single purpose.  My education and experience taught me that trees are a renewable resource and when they are not renewable, they shouldn&#39;t be  harvested.  I&#39;m not insensitive to the demand for timber in Idaho. But I&#39;d  like to stressâ€”and I included a newspaper article with my testimonyâ€”that the timber demand is much more important than the  supply. Last Friday an article ran in the Lewiston Morning Tribune saying that the timber recovery has been slowed down by a  lack of demand again. We&#39;ve just come out of a recession where the  timber products were not in demand. This recession was not a func   tion of the supply of timber, nor will the wilderness system be a  function to affect that supply. Demand has much more to do with  it.  You can take a short drive between headquarters and the North  Fork of the Clearwater and see acres and acres of private land,  much more productive land, which is much more suited to harvesting timber. Those acres are waiting to be reforested. They&#39;re not  being reforested because right now it&#39;s cheaper to log on Federal  land where the taxpayers are subsidizing road building than it is to  go and reforest that private land. It seems to me that this is the  classic western tradition of cut and run. We classically move on to  the next hill where the resources of the hill aren&#39;t depleted. I&#39;d like  to submit that we&#39;ve run out of hills in Idaho. And it&#39;s time to start  managing our productive west for timber production.  Research by the Forest Service and others indicate that the  demand in the United States for timber can&#39;t be met if lands are  already accessed. More productive lands are reforested.  Finally, I&#39;d like to talk about soft release for a minute. And like I  said, I&#39;m a land manager. A few years down the road I&#39;d like to  have the opportunity to decide whether or not the lands can be  considered for wilderness. I think that wilderness classifications  should remain part of forest planning for now in generations. We  don&#39;t know enough right now to decide what area will be wilderness and what area won&#39;t be.  Thank you.",,CRAIG J.

Thank you, Senator.  I would like to advocate a great deal more wilderness in Idaho  with particular reference to the Clearwater National Forest. The  last half-century I&#39;ve gone out to personallyâ€”not only once, but  many times I&#39;ve seen the list of these roadless areas first hand  time and again. The list goes as follows here. First there&#39;s the  Grandmother Mountain area northeast of Clarkia. Then there&#39;s the  Mallard Larkins area further to the east. There&#39;s the Great Burn  area which includes the headwaters to Kelley Creek. It extends  into Montana. There&#39;s an area in Cayuse Creek which is a beautiful pristine area at which it joins anther area called Bighorn  Weitas and a smaller area south of Kelley Creek called Moose  Mountain. Further into the headwaters is the Lochsa and we have  479  Elk Summit. Another tributary to the Lochsa which is highly critical for fish productionâ€”anadromous fish is Fish Creek.  Now, I&#39;ve seen all these areas. At the same time I&#39;ve designed  sawmills all that length of time. And when you go from one place  to another from up in the high mountains back of the sawmill, you  get an idea of what it takes to run a mill. And from what I&#39;ve seen  up there, most of the ideas people have about operating sawmills  on the kinds of timber available in these areas are pipe dreams.  You can&#39;t run a mill if you don&#39;t have some logs. And the logs that  have been raised up there are scattered and of small size. And they  take so long to grow that I don&#39;t see how in the world they&#39;re ever  going to make anything out of it if they&#39;s consider the long term.  The watershed value, however, is important. A few years ago my  daughter took a trip to the Middle East and reported when she got  back that in many European cities in the Middle East the only  water available is bottled spring water. We don&#39;t want to let Idaho  get to that horrible state. With the water gone and the resources  washing down the stream over there, about all the people seem to  think about is how the mountain artillery is doing shooting each  other off.  We need to keep our resources here on hand so we can find some  other pastime. Now, this isâ€”these areas are excessively steep. I  used to serve as a lookout on Sawtooth Peak. And you could roll a  rock right down from behind the lookout and see it go for a long     ways down into the Sawtooth Creek. It practically rolled clear  down into the creek.  Another example, on the Eagle Peak lookout had to get the cans  out of sight so it would pass inspection so the Forest Service  wouldn&#39;t see them. And he just tossed them off of the back porch  over a bluff. And they rolled down there far enough that you&#39;d  have to take you a half day to go down there where they were.",,MORTON R.

Senator McClure, Idaho is what America was, as my  shirt says here.  Idaho is what America was in large part because of the remaining remnants of roadless lands Idaho is blessed with. This hearing  today is to help decide how much of that roadless remnant America and Idaho will be allowed to retain.  We are discussing how much Idaho&#39;s character should be  changed to more closely resemble the factories of the Midwest or  the suburbs of Washington, D.C.  Idaho&#39;s high standard of livingâ€”the clean water, the good hunting and fishing and river raftingâ€”are based in large degree on  roadless areas providing good watershed and good habitat.  As Todd Maddock of the Idaho Forest Council has pointed out,  roadless areas and wilderness has, &#39;psychic benefits for the average citizen in Idaho and the rest of the country.&#39; I urge the other  members of this committee, as well as yourself, to take into account these difficult to quantify values.     Wilderness is here in Idaho. We can&#39;t make new wilderness in  Maryland or Delaware.  There are, of course, economic values to be also to be considered  in this process. Another Idaho Republican politician, Attorney General Jim Jones, recognizes the economic value of wilderness in an  interview with the Lewiston Morning Tribune in June. He said  contributing to larger fish runs are streams closed for development  by recent wilderness legislation and the Federal Wild and Scenic  Rivers Act. That is good news not only for anglers, but for Idaho&#39;s  economy as well. Steelhead fishing in the State contributed $11.5  million to the economy during 1982; and although that was a  banner year, coming seasons could see that figure double and possibly triple.  Something he didn&#39;t mention was the fact that not only the designated wilderness provide this habitat, but it&#39;s also the de facto  wilderness such as is typified in Clearwater drainage just where no  development has occurred.  Jones recognizes the economic value of roadless areas and wilderness areas. And I hope you do as well.  To the degree you do recognize wilderness values, Senator  McClure, Idaho will remain what America was.  To the degree you don&#39;t recognize the wilderness strength of  Idaho, Idaho will become that much more like suburban Virginia  or Maryland where you currently reside.  Senator McClure, please let Idaho stay Idaho.  Thank you.","Mr. Alan G. Marshall.

Senator McClure, I&#39;m Alan G. Marshall, a resident of Lewiston. And I would like to say that development of national forests in Idaho is proceeding rapidly but sometimes without  much thought. I&#39;m testifying about one area in particular; the  Kelly Creek drainage in the Clearwater National Forest. I also  would like to testify a little about policy; that of making irrevocable decisions about roadless areas.  I would like to say that Kelly Creek area is nationally famous as  a blue-ribbon cutthroat trout fishery. At one time, in fact, the  stream to which it is a tributary, the North Fork of the Clearwater  River, was famous for 4 and 6 pound cutthroat, as well as salmon  and steelhead. They no longer exist as a result of development. Development of areas such as Toboggan Ridge area will inevitably destroy Kelly Creek as a fishery because that ridge forms one slope of  Kelly Creek. Current proposal, which include timber sales and road  building, inadequately protect this resource. This year, as in seasons past, I spent a week on Kelly and Cayuse Creeks. I saw the  survey markers for the road. The new road will be at least twice as  wide as the current 15-foot roadbed. It will be built on slops of 30  and 40 degrees. Significant erosion into both Cayuse and Kelly  Creeks must happen as a result of this. And the destruction of the  fishery will occur. This does not seem consistent with principles of  multiple use.     One last point about Kelly Creek drainage. One of the complaints I&#39;ve often heard is that industries can&#39;t plan into the future  without these areas. How about the State of Idaho? Much effort  has been made by the State of Idaho to manage the Kelly Creek  drainage for fisheries. We should not destroy those efforts by building roads in this area.  Finally, we should not make final decisions about the development of all roadless areas now. We should make the decisions at  the time that the need for development exists, and when information relevant to that time and place exists. Who knows what will  be significant for us in 10 or 20 years?  Development of the national forests is inevitable. It is the direction of development that is in question. Kelly Creek is already developed in the sense that it is managed as a nationally significant  fisheries resource. We should not throw it away. Furthermore,  making hard decisions about the future of all roadless areas does  not make good planning sense from the public&#39;s point of view. The  development and the price of development should be arranged at  the time of need. We should not tie our grandchildren&#39;s hands.  Thank you.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator McClure.     I&#39;ve lived in Idaho County all my life. And I have worked there  all my life my working years. I have been in and out of all the wildernesses we have in the area. I hunt and fish and enjoy it tremendously.  At the age of 18 when I graduated out of high school, I first  began work for the Bureau of Public Roads as an engineering aid.  For 4 years I&#39;ve worked mostly in the roadless areas of Newsome  Creek, Red River and cut off of Red River on Highway 14 and  Highway 12, which is Lewis and Clark Highway. But after 4 years,  this type of work came to an end. Not wanting to leave, I went into  partnership with my own brothers at the home ranch.  At the time of my employment with the Bureau of Public Roads,  my first job was to run levels up roadless Newsome Creek. This I  had mixed feelings about as my father&#39;s range allotment was in  that area. Also, my favorite hunting and fishing area was there. If  we put a road in there, it could possibly destroy the whole works.  But the roads went in, the loggers started cutting clear cuts. And  some of those I felt were too big; and they were. Roads all over and  campers and so on up and down the meadows. Well, so then cattle  and loggers, that mixed pretty good. But then campers didn&#39;t like  the cattle in their campgrounds. And you can&#39;t blame them at all.  So, here comes the Forest Service telling us we had to keep our  cattle out of the meadows. So, we took them up into the higher  country. My father had been running these cattle in there since  1938. And so, we did the best we could to move them up there. And  then they come and said, well, you got to keep them out of the  clearcuts. This created some problems. Well, we did the best we  571  could. And it looked like there was possibly going to be an end of  hunting and grazing in Newsome. As time went along, the hunting  got better because of the feed. And you say, well, how could that  be? Well, first of all, all the clearcuts, roads, and things, which  some of the roads I felt were overconstructed, began to grow grass  and brush. There began to be an increase of feed for both cattle  and elk. Thus making the range better for cattle and wildlife alike.  The roads gave better access for us and the cows into some of the  roadless areas. With the trails at best it was very, very poor. There  was brush higher than your head on a horse and also very thick  timber. To make a long story short, Newsome Creek has become a  favorite camping, fishing, and hunting area for old and young  alike. I think it&#39;s about time we start looking at our retired people  as a local asset. They have homes, pay taxes, and spend money locally. They do not take jobs from the local people. But we do very  little to provide things for them to do. Newsome Creek has become  one of the very favorites of the old people.  I do not think all the roads should beâ€”should or can be used for  recreation. The U.S. Forest Service has done a very good job in  Newsome Creek on this with gates and et cetera.  As far as grazing, I was wrong at first in thinking all would be  lost. It has increased. We used to use 70 percent of the usage of the  area.

He is also a school teacher at the  Lewiston High School. And he teaches environmental science, wildlife, and biology and being a licensed river guide on the Snake and  Salmon River for 10 years. This testimony deals with the 18,000acre proposed Moose Mountain Wilderness.  I have hunted and hiked the Moose Mountain area off and on for  15 years. Most of this area has very little merchantible timber. It  was hit by wildfires in the early part of the century. The land is  very steep, soil is thin and rocky, and at the end of one glacial lake  is the steepest, highest head wall I have seen in Idaho.  637  This general area is known to support the rare and endangered  grizzly and the timber wolf. Last fall, while scouting the area, we  saw mountain goats. These animals are relatively few in number in  the State and the Fish and Game Department has had to greatly  reduce controlled hunt permits for them. This area has not been  open for years, if ever, to goat hunting. With logging roads intrusion by man into their environment would threaten this isolated  population.  In addition, we saw a large fisher, the second I have seen in the  area in 5 years. This rare protected member of the weasel family  was extirpated in the early part of the century by fur trappers. It  was reintroduced by the Fish and Game Department a number of  years ago.  Wilderness status would help to protect a number of rare and endangered animals.  Most of this proposed wilderness area is impossible to access by a  horse, and extremely difficult to hunt even on foot. It thus provides  excellent escape habitat for deer, elk, bear, and moose, which are  heavily hunted around this island especially on the northeast unregenerated burns and clearcuts.  Wilderness status would also eliminate any danger of siltation  from this area to the two premiere fishing streams, the North Fork  and the Kelly Creek.  Thank you.","Thank you very much.

I&#39;ve lived in this State since  1922. I first went to work in the wood products industry in 1939.  And with the exception of 5 years out for World War II, I&#39;m still in  the industry.  I&#39;ve worked both in the woods and in the mills. At present, I am  employed as a machinist in the papermill here at Lewiston.

And of the approximately 140 voting  delegates at that convention, the resolution passed without a dissenting vote. So the workers in this State are interested in getting  this issue settled.  I believe that the wilderness area that we presently have set  aside in the State of Idaho and the approximately 600,000 acres  that is proposed by the forest products industry should be sufficient. If a person decided to explore this vast amount of land and  he set a goal of 100 square miles a year, it would take him almost  69 years to see it. So this should be enough. Timber is a crop. It  should be harvested. Jobs are important, and they can be provided  with this renewable natural resource that we have here in this  State.  Thank you, Senator.","Thank you. Virgil Kromer.

I believe that the RARE II program that was finalized and  supposedly satisfied the environmentalists and also the lumber industries had plenty of wilderness set aside within these areas. Logging is our livelihood. There is enough unemployment right now.  With more timber set aside for wilderness, that means less jobs for  the loggers.

Cassell. I&#39;m George Cassell, superintendent of  schools here in Lewiston. I would stress that I am not representing  the district but am merely presenting my own point of view as a  school administrator.  Senator, I would support and encourage the adoption of proposal  No. 2 as outlined in your recent newsletter. This provides for the  addition of about a half a million acres of wilderness to the current  3.8 million acres of wilderness area. I would also encourage that  the balance of the 6.5 million acres of nondesignated roadless areas  be managed as multiple-use areas. I feel this would permit the recreational, timber, grazing; and mineral potential of these areas to  be maximumly developed for the benefit of all the people of Idaho.  I want to emphasize that I strongly support the current wilderness system and want to commend such organizations as the Sierra  Club, the Idaho Conservation League, the Idaho Environmental  Council for their tireless efforts to perpetuate the wilderness concept. However, as a superintendent of schools, I am concerned  about Idaho&#39;s children. A recent report by the National Commission on Excellence in Education titled &#39;A Nation At Risk&#39; indicates that we need significant improvement in America&#39;s schools if     we are to remain competitive internationally. America must develop its human resources. A 1982 report completed by the Idaho  Commission on Excellence in Education concurred in many of the  major recommendations for change within public schools. To effectively implement the recommendations of these reports, it will take  additional revenue. Of the 50 States of these United States, Idaho  currently ranks about 49th in its effort to support education. Also,  in Idaho, we are currently about 19 percent below our surrounding  States in our level of professional salaries. We are currently losing  some of our best staff to other States due to this salary differential.  Our supply of teachers nationally is starting to diminish. Within  several years it appears we will have a teacher shortage. However,  as we face the future, we will not be able to maintain even ourcurrent level of quality much less that demanded by both the National  and State Commissions on Excellence if we do not have a significant increase in revenue for public schools. We need this additional  revenue if we are going to become competitive in the marketplace  for the best teachers available.  Though the Lewiston School District does not directly receive  any Forest Service funds, the economy of Lewiston is significantly  affected by Potlatch Corp., the major employer in this area. Potlatch Corp. is highly dependent on the timber resources of the national forest for its operation. Its welfare significantly affects the  amount of revenue available for Lewiston public schools. Also, because we receive a significant amount of our revenue from the  State of Idaho, any economic benefit that the State of Idaho would  derive from wise and efficient use of an additional 6 million acres  of public lands would directly benefit the public schools.  721  Let us retain a sound wilderness system. What is being proposed  here would make Idaho second only to Alaska in the amount of  land that is set aside for wilderness purposes. However, let us encourage legislation that will permit the use of the remaining approximately 6 million acres of roadless areas in a way that these  resources will be used to best serve the people of Idaho including  providing additional resources to educate the youth of this State.","Dr. Cassell, your time has expired.

I moved to this area  about 5 years ago from Michigan, which is one of the States that as  somebody referred to earlier lost most of its virgin timber. Ajid  there&#39;s now a small area, perhaps 10 to 15 acres of virgin white  pine left there. This made a marked impression on me. And I guess  I came to Lewiston primarilyâ€”I felt like talking after listening to a  number of arguments of people who appear to feel that their livelihood is threatened by the possible inclusion of what to me seems  like a relatively small area of wilderness that currently has not  been logged and may well not be but would be offered some protection by the wilderness status.  My remarks are basically not factual. They are based on feelings.  I have the sense that the emotions underlying the threat to livelihood are very compelling. I believe that this should be weighed.  But I also believe that we need to examine whether, in fact, taking  the State of Idaho as a whole and perhaps the Nation as a whole,  whether the current downturn and pessimism and concern about  the future of the timber industry here is really linked in any direct  way to the rather small additions that we might be contemplating  or at least groups such as the Idaho Conservation League might be  contemplating. It appears to me that it has to do with other factors. And quite candidly, that some of the timber industry has to     some degree found a suitable scapegoat in the wilderness issue for  conditions that are much broader than this matter.  I think it should beâ€”that the area that would be made available  to the timber industry should be safeguarded, also. But I want to  make a point that the rather small percentage thatâ€”of irreplacable existing wilderness deserves consideration, also.  Thank you.",Thank you.

I was glad to see you two fellows here because I  think you&#39;re doing your job and it&#39;s fine. I gave Mr. Symms a statement here a few years ago. And my concern is about just the roads  in the back country. For the crippled veteransâ€”there&#39;s quite a few  of them around the countryâ€”and the senior citizens would like to  go out in these places and see the beauty of the country, too. And  it&#39;s a great experience the young fellows was saying here to go out  there. Most of these areasâ€”like, they speak of from McCall to Warrens to McCall to Elk Summit to Yellow Pine and one lake and  that&#39;s the Cascades. Probably I think it&#39;s as beautiful as the  parksâ€”Yellowstone Park. But one thing we want to doâ€”I noticed  the guys in the backâ€”guides and packersâ€”they brag sometime ago  about close a lot of roads. Well, when they close the roads, they  close us older citizens out. They close the crippled veterans out.  And I think that we have to manage our forests although Iâ€”I was  32-427 0â€” 84 48  746  raised in the back country there. Raised right by Warrens, Yellow  Pine, and right through there. And we used to go along and go fishing. And we didn&#39;t have to worry about anything. It was a beautiful country and was nothing to bother us. We didn&#39;t even have a  gun. We had a fishing pole. Maybe just 12 years old or so. And I  had quite a few experiences in there. Like, I was theâ€”me and another kid was the second menâ€”white men down on the south fork  of the Salmon before the Forest Service built the trail on the righthand side. And we seen where the old Indians had parkedâ€”had  their tepee poles and Mackey Bar where the airport is now. And  we seen the Indian writing and all. And it&#39;s a beautiful sight. But  one thing we got to think ofâ€”and I think they forgot to think  about it that I use to work during the summers for the Forest Service. And we was only 12 years old when we started working for the  Forest Service. And I been around when they logged. And that surprises me is they&#39;ve done a real good job in that part of the country  of logging. I don&#39;t seeâ€”I couldn&#39;t kick on their logging. They got  the timber out and they utilized it. Took it down and put it to  market. And the mines in that part of the country got the ore out  and the concentrates and shipped them in, and we all live in a  wooden house. We all drove a car here today that come out of the  mines. Some old miner worked pretty hard getting them concentrates out for us so they could build that car. So we got to think of  them, and we got to think of our economy.","Thank you, Mr. McDonald.

Good afternoon, Honorable Senator James  McClure and Honorable Senator Steve Symms. We&#39;re delighted you  are with us here in Lewiston. I don&#39;t have a prepared talk. I didn&#39;t  even know about registration for this except a little scanty material I got out of the Lewiston Tribune. Also, I&#39;d like to recognize  Alan Slickpoo of the Nez Perce Nation, a friend of mine, and part  representative of the Nez Perce Tribe. And he was remarking that  he represented a different government. Probably American creed  750  which says we&#39;re made up of sovereign nations and many sovereign  States should also include many sovereign Indian nations which we  have.  I think, Senator McClure, the last time we were together we did  attend a long house religious ceremony in the Nez Perce Reservation which we try to follow the best we could. Since that time, I&#39;ve  attended several more of those. And I know a little bit more about  it. When you come next time, I&#39;ll give you some more instructions.  My name is Joseph Feathers. I do live on the Moon Rising Ranch  which is on the Nez Perce Reservation. I guess I&#39;m a guest of the  tribe. I&#39;ve been there 15 years. And before that I lived in Beaverhead County, southwest Montana. So I think I know this area quite  well.  As I said, I didn&#39;t know anything about this meeting until I read  it in the paper. I greatly admire the Hunt Papa Sioux medicine  man, Sitting Bull who once said: &#39;A great man is a person who  does the best he can with what he has.&#39; And I don&#39;t have much to  do with today so I&#39;ll be as great as I can.  The Tribune did boil down the problem here today. And you  people have certainly identified the two areas. The questions boil  down to two sides; saving roadless areas for futureâ€”for the future  because of the values they possess and developing roadless areas  for timber and logging and grazing. And I think you people have  taken those two sides.     My point of view would be that of the Wilderness Society and  Sierra Club and such groups like that in Idaho. Any myselfâ€”I&#39;d  like a wilderness that is untouched and undisturbed. But I think  maybe we ought to put the fires out burning the wilderness.

Thank you, Senator McClure, My name is Royce G.  Cox. And I&#39;ve enjoyed the good quality of life in Idaho for some 43  years. All made possible by this wonderful forest resource we&#39;re  discussing today. I commend you, Senator McClure, and the others  for holding these hearings in Idaho close to the people who will be  most directly affected by resolution of the roadless controversy. I  agree that this issue should be resolved as soon as possible.  I say this because one highly important aspect of multiple use,  and I add sustained yield, forest resource management is the necessity of controlling fire, insects, and disease. Adequate road access is  essential for this intensive management which is not currently possible in the roadless areas. I personally am saddened by the unnecessary loss of timber and esthetic values which has occurred al758  ready in the roadless areas, particularly in the highly valuable  stands of white pine from a combination of blister rust and bark  beetles. The longer management is delayed, the greater these losses  become.  As you know, I&#39;m a retired professional forester with a longstanding interest in wilderness and 40 years experience in the protection, management, and utilization of privately owned, industrial  forest resources.  In addition, my wife and I own a small tree farm near Orofino  which we hope to pass on to our children and grandchildren.  As you also know, I&#39;ve testified many times in support of the  preservation of a reasonable acreage of wilderness on Federal  public lands, including testimony of the hearings on the original  wilderness bill and the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area.  From a purely selfish viewpoint, I should support maximum wilderness preservation because the resulting decrease in available  commercial timber would automatically increase the economic  value of my tree farm.  However, while I am still strong and while I still strongly support wilderness, I firmly believe the acreage designated should not  jeopardize the total environmental health of our society which includes jobs and other economic considerations as well as esthetic,  wildlife, and accessible outdoor recreation.  In my opinion, Idaho already has nearly enough high quality wil   derness. Therefore, in general, I support the Idaho Forest Industry  Council&#39;s proposal for adding some 500,000 to 600,000 acres of wilderness to the 3.8 million acres already designated in Idaho.  In conclusion, I don&#39;t know whether this has been discussed yet,  as a possible compromise on the roadless-wilderness issue, I propose  that Congress and the U.S. Forest Service reconsider the Forest  Service&#39;s designation of additional areas similar to the MallardLarkins Pioneer Area. This concept makes sense to me in that  within some of the smaller primitive-type but relatively accessible  areas, a minimum of amenities is permitted; such as, pit toilets and  pack-stock hitching rails but no timber harvesting. This makes  such areas much easier to manage from sanitation and vegetation  protection standpoints.  Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to present this statement.","Thank you all. I have no questions of this panel.

Thank you very much for your testimony. Is there anyone else

present who desires the opportunity to be heard who has not yet

been heard? That would, then, conclude this hearing; and with that

would conclude the series of four hearings in Idaho. We have heard

a total of 579 witnesses in four such hearings; 180 in Boise, 112 in

Idaho Falls, 161 in Coeur d'Alene, and 126 today in Lewiston.

As I indicated earlier, the record will remain open until Septem-

ber 2 for the comments of witnesses and other persons who desire

to contribute to the hearing record. Again, those of you who desire

to have a copy of the hearing recordâ€”would you please register on

a self-addressed envelope. You will then receive a copy of the com-

plete hearing record when that has been printed. It will be some

months from now before that&#39;s completed because the record will

remain open until September 2. But the staff, then, must edit all

759

the material and send it to the Government Printing Office where

it will, in due course, be printed and then made available to the

public. It will be sometime before that&#39;s done. So if you have re-

quested a copy or do request a copy of the hearing record, don&#39;t

become too impatient and assume that somehow you&#39;ve been over-

looked just because it&#39;s a couple weeks past September 2 and you

haven&#39;t seen yours.

today possible. Thank Lewis-Clark College, the staff, and the great

work we&#39;ve had from the reporters who have really done the hard

work here today, the sound man who&#39;s tried to keep us equally

hearable throughout this room this afternoon, and to those on the

staff who have made all these arrangements and kept up with

what we&#39;re doing, and to the Lord who&#39;s holding the ceiling up. I

Thank you. My remarks will be in reference to the Lemhi Range on the Salmon National Forest, specifically the Everson Creek, Stroud Creek, and Porcupine Creek drainages re cently referred to by the Forest Service as the Mill Creek timber sale.  Whereas the Leadore Community is a ranching community and water is essential to the survival of our ranches and as the narrow band of foliage and trees crossing these drainages is very vital as a watershed, and as the planned roading and commercial timber sales would follow around through this vital watershed and with early spring runoff already creating problems with shortages of water later in the summer, any disturbance, any roading or remov ing of timber in this area, would only aggravate the problem. And     750 as the timber in this particular area is low in quality and quantity and it would be timbered at a loss, as stated by the Forest Service in the meeting held on May 25, and as we have witnessed in other areas, there would be great waste and destruction of the foliage and trees that are vital for other values. And as this is a cold dry climate with a very short growing season, regeneration and produc tivity is a slow and difficult struggle and not a timber producing area, we feel the other values should have prestige and not be sac rificed. We can be sure that once this road is established encircling the valley through this mountain range there will be continual sales, more waste and destruction, more and more barren areas, more and more early runoff of water, more and more problems with dry, burning pastures and fields, more and more harassment, killing, wounding, and rustling of livestock, more and more wildlife being driven out and down onto the ranches, more and more confusion of wildlife and destruction of wildlife habitat, less and less material for posts, poles, and firewood, which is limited and essential to the people of this remote area, and more and more taxes for the upkeep of these roads and more and more pollution of the streams. We have felt that this area could best be used and enjoying by the visitors to the area as well as by the local people and that long range values to the ranching community, visitors, and future gen erations could best be conserved if past management could be maintained. However, since the Forest Service has not chosen this alternative, we feel our best choice to protect the vital watershed, the wildlife habitat, the livestock, and the esthetic values may be a wilderness status if the use of grazing, the use of dead wood, the fire protection, could be guaranteed, and I would like to recom mend that the necessary changes be made in the wilderness bill for this. I cannot accept the concept of letting the grass grow and the dead wood pile up and then when a fire starts, whether by man or by lightning, sitting idly by and letting these resources go up in flames when we have the means to put them out when they first start. I feel it is man&#39;s responsibility to protect as well as use and enjoy with prudence and gratitude. Thank you.",Thank you.

I&#39;m Elizabeth Udy. I came to the Leadore area in 1936, and I&#39;m still a rancher in the Big Eight Mile area. I appreciate this opportunity to bring in a petition from David Udy that was unable  to come this morning. He had planned to be here, and so this is his petition. As a rancher of the Leadore area, I am concerned about the sales of the Big Eight Mile and the Mill Creek timber of the Leadore District of the Salmon National Forest. As a community and also as an individual, we have opposed this sale for the last 10 years. This is timber of poor quality and is a slow regeneration area. Also, this is a calving ground for elk, and logging of this area would push the elk out of this area. The Forest Service argues that the elk are on the increase and would not be affected; however, it is my opinion that the elk were not on the in crease until they logged the Swan Basin area on the south and the Hayden Creek area on the north and pushed the elk from both di rections into this area. Also, logging would cause roads that would make the area more accessible for cattle rustling and poaching of game. The way this forested area has been managed in the past has been suitable and working fine, which should be apparent to the Forest Service by the letters and petitions against their decision to timber this area. But it is apparent that the Forest Service cannot live with some thing that works. They seem to feel if they are not destroying, they are not managing. So rather than seeing what we have destroyed by poor Forest Service management, I would like to see this area put back into the wilderness study. However, in the wording of the wilderness bill concerning graz ing of livestock, I would like to see it changed from may be permit ted to graze to shall be permitted to graze. Also, I would like to see added to the bill that the continued use of power tools for trail clearing and maintenance of existing trails was permitted. I also would like to see a proposal put into the bill so that ranch ers of the area could, by primitive methods, continue to have access to poles and posts for fencing, and also firewood. And may I make a comment on that. As I was saying, for all these years ranching there, that we have snow; we have high water runoff in the spring, and we are about out in August; many of them are turned off. And I feel that we need all the trees we can  774  hold up there to hold the snow and bring this later water that we need so badly. And the whole community depends on it. We have little stores there in Leadore County that we get a few groceries from, and our gas. Now, those stores depend upon the prosperity of the ranchers. And if the ranchers dry up and leave, well, what ones were left would have to go around 50 miles to Salmon to get a gallon of milk or fill our gas tanks. And, therefore, I think it&#39;s very important that we do this. And I would like to present the map presented by Dr. Smith from Salmon, I copied it, that this would be approved by the community in general. I like multiple use, but I do like to have a watershed and summer water.

You will be listening to much testimony here today which will show how very substantial the recreation industry in Idaho is. So sufficed to say that mine is just one of the many mouths directly fed by tourists who visits our area. Why do the tourists come here? Why do they choose Idaho? They come here because it&#39;s different. It&#39;s not like Detroit or Los Ange les. It&#39;s got large chunks of unspoiled land that belongs to us all. Those areas support healthy wildlife populations which are total ly dependent upon the roadless character of their habitat. The water quality is high and the air is clear. Fishing is good. It&#39;s the way this country used to be. And for these reasons, the tourists come to Idaho for their vacations. They spend their money and they go back home, leaving things pretty much as they found them. Idaho is regarded by them as a national heritage and we must insure that it be protected for future generations to enjoy. I recommend that you include the endangered Idaho wilderness Core areas which will be presented to you in October in your legis lation. I urge you to include so-called soft release language in your bill because this is not an issue which should be excluded from future consideration.

Senator McClure, which of Idaho&#39;s roadless na tional forest lands do we want to give up? Which herd of elk or an telope? Which wolves or mountain goats will we sacrifice? Which streams or rivers will be allowed to be polluted, and which fisheries abandoned? Of the remnants of America&#39;s forests, which will we  preserve for the next generation? Civilization, industries, and more people are pressing in on Idaho&#39;s wild areas. Many Idahoans who answer that Idaho needs no more wilderness do not realize that their favorite fishing streams, hiking trails, or hunting areas are not protected from mining or timber sales. Will fish be in that stream next year or will they be driven out by pollution caused by a logging road or leaking tailings pond? Will the wildlife be replaced by a hole in the ground? Do we really place the proper value on roadless or wilderness areas? How important are they to Idaho? Idaho&#39;s future is in these protected wild areas. They are what makes tourism and recreation Idaho&#39;s growing second industry. We must make long range plans for our State and cannot continue to subsidize logging companies to cut the last tree. We cannot continue to ride the boom and bust of mineral extrac tions. These consumptive industries are nothing on which to base a stable economy. We must maintain our forests in multiple use and, judging from the past record of the U.S. Forest Service, wilderness designation seems to be the only way of doing that. I am particularly concerned with maintaining the roadless areas in the Sawtooths and White Clouds and Boulder Mountains. The SNRA, much used by recreationists from throughout the United States and Idaho, is the core of an area rich in wildlife and scenic values. We must protect it with wilderness status. High recreational values of the Sawtooth extensions and eastern White Clouds and the Boulders will take some pressure off the  322  SNRA. The enlarged White Clouds Wilderness must include winter wildlife which has re  as well as summer range for the variety of  treated there. Idaho must wake up. We haven&#39;t much longer to decide to save our heritage and pass it along.  Thank you.","Thank you.

Mr. Chairman and committee members, my name is Pat McGinnis. I&#39;live in Ketchum, Idaho, just a stone&#39;s throw from some of the majestic mountain ranges of central Idaho. Right now my town is jammed with a steady stream of traffic, vehicles from all parts of the United States taking people through this scenic recreation area. Not all will leave their cars and camp  ers behind to venture forth on foot into these rich, roadless areas, but for those who wish to, the opportunity should always be there. I wait in line to buy gas and groceries on Saturday mornings, but I don&#39;t mind. I am headed for the mountains, too. I am an Idahoan who wants to keep Idaho for everyone. When I was a foruth grade student in Idaho Falls studying Idaho history, I learned that even though our license plates boasted of famous potatoes we were also known as the Gem State. Several years and many scenic journeys later I realized that it wasn&#39;t the deposits of silver, gold, lead, and molybdenum that gave Idaho its nickname. In my mind, it was the mountains, forests, lakes, streams, and wildlife that made Idaho a gem in the true sense of the word. I stand before this committee today because I feel my birthright is being threatened by greedy corporations that want to open up our wilderness areas to make a buck mining and logging our natu ral resources with no conscienceness about what they leave behind. I have lived in northern Idaho several years and have seen the devastation of the Silver Valley. Sure, those mines provided a living for a few people for a few years. However, I can t help but remember returning to Kellogg on the day the Bunker Hill mine was closing because profits were down and it had been sold to a Texas corporation. I don&#39;t know which was worse, the rape of the countryside or the destruction of a whole community of people, in cluding lead poisoning of their children. I&#39;ll never forget the shock and sadness I felt while driving through some of the backroads of Wallace and Kellogg. I thought people only existed like this in the coal mining regions of Kentucky  and West Virginia; not in Idaho. A few months after my trip to the Panhandle, I witnessed the same kind of madness much closer to home. I toured the Challis and Thompson Creek area where ASARCO was gearing up their operations for a molybdenum mine. It made me very angry to see a once beautiful drainage area being desecrated by huge machines and dynamite in quest of a metal of which there is no shortage and not really much demand. After 2 years of roadbuilding and getting rid of the overburden, which, in my dictionary, means vegetation and wildlife, not one ounce of molybdenum has been mined for sale. The only result is that the town of Challis experienced a false boom, with a high rate  361  of crime and heavy impacts on public lands and rivers bordering the area.",,PATRICIA McGINNIS,"KETCHUM, IDAHO",Mcginnis,Patricia,h1d1,"mcginnis, patricia",Ketchum (CITY); United States (COUNTRY); Idaho Falls (CITY); Idaho (STATE); Silver Valley (LANDFORM); Kellogg (CITY); Texas (STATE); Kentucky (STATE); West Virginia (STATE); Challis (CITY); Thompson Creek (STREAM); Challis (FOREST),text

Senator McClure, my name is Karen Reinheimer.  I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;m from Blaine County, and as a concerned voter and taxpayer of Idaho, I urge you to protect the specified en dangered lands under consideration today. Oftentimes the land developers, both in mining and logging, do not live in Idaho. These operations are here only as long as busi ness proves to be lucrative. Then they are gone, leaving behind our once untouched and beloved mountains and lakes, an unnatural wasteland no longer fit for hiking, camping, hunting or fishing.  367     And I&#39;m afraid most of the 1 million visitors to the Sawtooth Na tional Recreational Area may be well long gone, too. Having hailed from New York City, I carry the clear memory of masses of poverty stricken areas, physically polluted lands, and a psychologically lost people. Lauded as the true backbone of Amer ica, this is the product of our financial Mecca&#39;s, both east and west. And will this then be the beginning of our true poverty in Idaho? I think that the magnitude of this tragedy of our diminishing unroaded lands will someday warrant its being named the Second Cruxification. There was once a different time. But now gone are the bear and elk, fresh waters and clear horizons. Why would anyone want to take away our last small legacy of land that speaks of a natural order so rapidly disappearing in our lands? I will graduate as a grade school teacher next year. I know that the monetary return on potential mining and logging operations in these endangered areas will directly rob the heritage of our chil dren. I pray that someday I will not stand before these children and tell them of a once noble land that was thrown away under the false guise of economic progress. I ask you to designate these lands as wilderness areas and not continue to hammer nails into the environmental coffin; for, as in all premature deaths, it will be a deep tragedy, and irreconcilable.","Thank you.

Senator McClure, Congressman Craig, frankly I would like to see as much of the RARE acreage in wilderness as possible; all of it, in fact. As mayor of Ketchum, in the past 8 years I have resided over with mixed emotions one of the largest percent  age building booms in the history of the State. Wilderness, we have found, has been very good for business, as we are one of the gateways to the outdoor recreation areas of the wilderness areas around us. As such, we have seen residential counts increase by a factor of three in the past 10 years. We have seen all forms of construction. A square footage basis probably in creased by 12 to 14 times. And with that, jobs, bank footings, all increases of economic ac tivity have been commensurate with that growth. For this reason, I&#39;m saying I would like it all in wilderness be cause I think it is probably one of the highest and best uses of that area for wilderness values that Americans are going to see in a tre mendous demand in the next 20 years. And I will venture to say  that many of the gateway cities to the wilderness areas are going to boom because of the demands we&#39;re going to see for those wilder ness areas, and, as such, I think economically it&#39;s a growth indus try and a provision for outdoor recreation values and those areas are going to be one of the great growth areas for the State of Idaho in the next 20 years.

Tourism is our second biggest industry for the State and growing  every year toward the largest, which is agriculture. The value of the tourist dollar in Idaho touches everybody in the State. When you decide upon the 6.5 million acres of roadless land, rethink the long-term economic value of having tourists return to the land year after year, spending their money on gas, food, houses, hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, climbing. This is a renewable re source. We don&#39;t have to build it.

We choose to live in a part of Idaho rich with recreational oppor tunities.

To insure roadless areas remain for bighorn sheep, mountain goat, cougar, elk, moose, bear, wolves, and deer. To keep the option of roadless wilderness open for us all, we urge you to protect the following areas as wilderness. And then the spe cific areas are listed in the written testimony. In quick conclusion, I would like to say again, please think of the long run. Visiting the Selway-Bitteroot wilderness area this last fall, I met a man named Emil Keck who this August 18 will have lived in the primitive area for the last 20 years and now rebuilds suspension pack bridges over the Selway and Moose Creek. This work is all done by hand with local cedar, handhewn into timbers, joined and fitted and eased into place all by his hand and  453     by himself. He&#39;s 70 years old this year and is as burly as the land in which he lives. If one has time Emil will talk your ear off. And it&#39;s time we need now so as best to decide on the future of Idaho&#39;s wild lands. For as Emil says about the Selway country ap plies to these lands in question as well.

Aug-09-1983,aug-09-1983-goodwin-andrew,,,"Goodwin, Andrew",,Ketchum,"Ketchum, Idaho",m,"Mr. Goodwin. Senator McClure, Congressman Craig and ladies  and gentlemen. The question before you is a very simple one and that question is, what amount of land in Idaho should be left unroaded and placed under wilderness protection? It is historically obvious that when something works perfectly it is better not to meddle with it. There has never been, in the history of our planet, a better example of something that works perfectly than wild lands in their original undisturbed state. Sadly, there are forces within and outside of Idaho which believe that commercial exploitation of these wild lands will make them work better. This ignores the fact that for untold centuries management poli cies have worked to enhance these lands. If private industry is now permitted to exploit them, you may be sure of two things: (a) That exploitation will irreparably degrade the wilderness to the point where future generations will have no wilderness and (b) somebody will make a hell of a lot of money. So the question really is, do we allow a few people to get rich at the cost of&#39; losing our wild land? I don&#39;t feel that we should. Trees for the timber industry can be farmed. In the near future synthetic substitutes for products which today are mined may very well be discovered.  Industry says that wilderness designation locks up economically productive lands and I must disagree. In 1981 tourism, according to the Idaho Division of Economic and Community Affairs, accounted for 320 million more dollars pumped into our economy than did mining and forest products put together. These people came to look at scenery, not mines and lumber mills. Now, I have no economic interest in this issue. I have spent all my life outdoors and I am still poor in money. But I am very, very wealthy from the beauty and grandeur of this wild Idaho.  461  There really is no question of how much roadless area should be It should all be under wilderness designation. If it is given to industry it will be to the later detriment of us all. We can never have enough wilderness. Thank you.","Thank you. Don Olowinski.

OK. My name is Terry Hershey. And, first of all,  I&#39;d like to thank you for this opportunity to present my views regarding the future management of Forest Service roadless areas in  Idaho. I&#39;d like to specifically address the Mallard-Larkins RARE H  roadless area, which is P1300. I feel that I&#39;m qualified to discuss  this area because I am a professional wildlife biologist and have  worked in this area over the past 4 years. I also have frequently  taken advantage of the recreational opportunities this area offers.  The Mallard-Larkins is a roadless subalpine area in north Idaho,  on the high divide between the Northfork of the Clearwater River     and the upper St. Joe drainages. And I support a wilderness designation of 175,000 to 200,000 acres in this area; including the boundaries stated in the original RARE II wilderness recommendation,  as well as additional acres.  The land is characterized by exceptional steep slopes with numerous rock outcrops, shallow and unstable soils, sensitive watersheds, and marginal timber producing sites. The economics of developing most of the Mallard-Larkins for timber harvest would be  highly unfavorable. Timber producting sites and values are marginal in this area relative to the more productive and accessible land  at lower elevations. Merchantable timber stands of saw log value  are few and widely scattered. And old growth mountain hemlock  stands dominate the higher elevations. Hemlock is not a valuable  saw log material. Its primary use is for fiber or pulpwood products.  Also, once harvested, hemlock sites are extemely slow and expensive to regenerate. To date, Forest Service silviculturists have been  unsuccessful in all previous efforts to regenerate hemlock habitat  types after timber harvest. Numerous acres of high elevation, unregenerated hemlock stands up to 20 years old on commercial forest  land adjacent to this area bare mute testimony to our futile efforts  to grow trees where an old growth forest of hemlock once stood. As  many as five unsuccessful planting attempts have been repeated on  some of the hemlock sites at a high cost to the taxpayer without  any foreseeable return on their investments within the next 150  years. A serai brushfield still persists on thousands of other acres  that were burned by catastrophic wildfires in this area in 1910 and  1934. Shallow, infertile soils, harsh growing conditions, and competition with brush will prolong the regeneration and growth of trees  653  on these sites. Roads to access the Mallard-Larkins will require  substantial amounts of appropriated money for harvesting small,  scattered tracks of relatively low value timber resources. Why use  tax money to build roads when not enough timber is available in  the area for sales to turn a profit and justify the cost of the roads?  Roads located on the exceptionally steep and unstable land types  characteristic of the area are extremely expensive to construct and  inevitably detrimental to the water quality and stability of streams  affected by construction activity. The increased erosion and sediment delivery to steams are subsequently damaging to the fishery  resource and their habitat. That&#39;s it.",,TERRY HERSHEY,"KAMIAH, IDAHO",Hershey,Terry,h2d2,"hershey, terry",Mallard-Larkins RARE H (WILDERNESS); Mallard-Larkins (WILDERNESS); Clearwater River (STREAM); St. Joe (STREAM),text

I&#39;m a country lawyer from Kamiah, which is a logging town. And the majority of my clients are either loggers or  millworkers. So I guess you could say that I indirectly earn my  living from the paper industry.  I want to see a stable, strong, productive timber industry in  Idaho. But I also want my children and my children&#39;s children to  be able to enjoy the same Idaho that I&#39;ve been able to enjoy. I want  to address my remarks and my testimony to the area that I know  best. It&#39;s pictured there on the map. And that is the Kelly-Cayuse  Creek area. I&#39;ve only logged 3 months out of my life. So I sure can&#39;t  consider myself a professional logger. But I tell you, that Toboggan  Ridge area that the Forest Service has plans to log is as steep as a  cow&#39;s face. The timber is so poor it&#39;s unreal. I think it&#39;s beyond  question that that would be a deficit timber sale financed by the  taxpayers of this country. I think it&#39;s beyond the question that the  Forest Service&#39;s own research documents it that it would significantly reduce the quality and the amount of fish in the entire  North Fork drainage. I think it&#39;s beyond the question that the lodgepole pine from that area would not go to Idaho mills but would  go to the nearest mill, which is in Superior, Mont.  So for all those reasons, Senator, I think the best thing that we  could do is to let the Cayuse-Kelly Creek area grow what it grows     best; that&#39;s elk and cutthroat trout. That will add to our economy, I  think, in the future particularly as areas like this become fewer  and farther between. Let&#39;s give the taxpayers a break and leave it  the way it it. I don&#39;t propose closing off any roads. I don&#39;t think we  have to keep motorcycles off the trails. I don&#39;t think we have to  have those kinds of restrictions. But I don&#39;t see any sense whatsoever in logging it. It&#39;s a boondoggle. And I thank you for this opportunity to testify.",Thank you very much.

Thank you Senator McClure. I came to Idaho from northern Illinois early in 1954. However, my high school and college education was obtained in the mountainous and forested areas of northeastern and central Pennsylvania. From the latter background, I was able to appreciate the uniquely pristine nature of the mountains, forests, and lakes and waterways of Idaho&#39;s great central batholith and corresponding areas to the north and south east. Over the years since I first came out here I have greatly en joyed the opportunity to visit such areas as the Priest Lakes, the Middle Fork of the Salmon, Loon Creek, and Falkenberry Lake, the Sawtooth and River of No Return Wilderness areas, the Sawtooth, Lemhi, Pioneer, Centennial, and Bighole mountain ranges, and the west slope of the Tetons. As I came to realize that Idaho has such tremendous wild areas, mostly forested, I commenced to buy the topographic maps of the State. I have accumulated them in order to comprehend much of this country. My maps include the big State map and 22 pertinent maps and, where available, their geologic counterparts. These give general relationships of contours and forest cover, but for detail it was necessary to acquire the standard topo maps with scales of 100 to 124 over the years. I now have about 150 such Idaho maps, as well as quite a few from other Western States, and practically all the maps of the national forests in Idaho. So I feel that I can speak from both direct and from detailed recorded information. It I don&#39;t remember the feature of interest, I know where to find it, includ ing the use of the map files of our public library. From my direct acquaintance, my own maps and others to which I have access, and by examination of the following principal docu ments, I firmly believe that Idaho can well afford to almost double the acreage of its relatively forested wilderness lands as compared to what it now has, which is about 3.8 million, and that this need not adversely affect the timber industry to a significant degree. This takes into consideration both the arid nature of much of the area, destructive biological forces now seriously damaging and costly harvesting practices now required.  725     Documents of interest include but are not limited to appendix G to the final EIS for RAKE II, the Idaho Fish and Game Department Special Alert, the ICL May /June Newsletter Wilderness Supple ment, the Idaho Wilderness Alert published by ICL, the Eastern Idaho Wilderness Alert distributed by Portneuf Audubon Society and others. High on my list for nearby wilderness definition are Italian Peaks, Lower and Upper Lemhis, Borah and Leaterman Peaks, Garns Mountain and Palisades, Mount Naomi and Cache Crest, Stump and Worm Creeks. Other very important areas are Salmo-Priest, Upper Priest Lake, the Selkirks peaks near the northern boundary of&#39; Idaho, Scotch man to Spion Kop, and the Mallard-Larkings and Big Burn area. When and if Idaho wilderness legislation is developed, I recom mend that it not include hard release language, that the option to continue proper management as wilderness be left to the Forest Service for the future.

Thank you very much, Senator McClure. I&#39;d like  to testify as a concerned citizen and a State legislator this morning. I&#39;ve found that many people have not set their priorities in order in this State. I feel that the majority of the people that are asking for more wilderness areas in Idaho are the same ones that are wanting a better education for their children. Can&#39;t these people see that when 69 percent of our land in Idaho is in public owner ship, it makes it rather hard to spread a tax base for education within the remaining 31 percent of the land. Idaho can&#39;t afford to lock up any more land. We need more money for the education system in Idaho and we won&#39;t get it by taking more land off the tax rolls. Testifying as a private citizen, I would like to express a few ob servations I have made. I fly a small plane and have flown over all sections of Idaho. I don&#39;t know if the general public realizes how much land we have in Idaho that is untouched. I have back packed throughout Idaho and I&#39;ve floated its rivers. We have a beautiful State with so much of it devoted to wilderness now, but we also need jobs for our people, to support a high level of lifestyle for our children and our grandchildren. I have seen the no growth advocates who come primarily from out of State. These entrepreneurs want to restrict Idaho&#39;s future growth, I feel. An example of this is because the moratoriums are locking up land. A personal note, that I purchased a lot in Ketchum, Idaho, over 20 years ago for $2,200, and because of some of these activities and tying up in the no growth area, this is now worth $110,000. I feel this is a fine example for present ownership of getting rich through skyrocketing costs, but it kind of puts the real estate out of reach, I feel, of our youngster generation or future generation, this type of activity.  572  Last but not least is the question of how long do we have to tie up a decision with bureaucratic maneuvering? Twenty years of study, plus costs to the taxpayer is enough. I feel the two opposing sides are not going to change their minds, continue hearings and review, so I suggest that we call the shot and make these decisions for the betterment of Idaho and our nations and get on with busi ness.

Thank you. Senator McClure. I&#39;m Jerry Jayne and  this is a statement for myself. It&#39;s difficult to overstate the worth of wilderness. Some of the more important ones include: The positive human expression of an evolving land ethic, ecological benchmarks and the scientific values related thereto, educational values, wildlife habitat, watershed pro tection, recreation and inspiration. And I find increasingly that one of the most important and tangible of these is the need for the pro tection of wildlife habitat because many species are largely depend ent upon the wilderness environment, and many of them are com pletely dependent upon it.  598  I think a basic question in this discussion should be relative to the existing wilderness resource; namely, how much wilderness is there in Idaho? And it&#39;s difficult to pin that down. My guess is that about 30 percent of Idaho is still wilderness; in fact 15 to 16 million acres, most of this is in the national forest. I&#39;ve seen no precise amount for this, but I derive a figure of roughly 13 million acres of national forest wilderness still existing in Idaho. It&#39;s derived as fol lows: 3.8 million are designated as wilderness, that&#39;s all that is pro tected; 5.6 million is left in the current Rare II inventory; 1 million was released from the Rare II inventory in the Central Idaho Wil derness Act of 1980 and is available for timber harvest, et cetera; and about 2Vz to 3 million acres were not inventoried in Rare II because they had been discussed and dropped from further consid eration in about 30 land use plans during the 1970&#39;s prior to Rare     II.  This is an estimate of the existing national forest wilderness, the actual wilderness. The roughly 4 million acres that are designated are the protected subset of this 13 million. The other 9 million are what are up for grabs; they are unprotected and unfortunately most of that amount is threatened by this hasty legislation which proposes release language on only a minimal designation of wilder ness. The other 8 million acres of national forests in Idaho are cur rently roaded and available generally for timber harvest. The next question which follows from this is how much of this 13 million acres of existing national forest wilderness in Idaho should be retained? Considering that every subtraction from this 13 mil lion acre base means the loss of some wildlife habitat and the dis ruption of existing natural ecosystem, considering also that in gen eral most of the best timberland is already available for timber harvest, then it seems reasonable to me to retain a large fraction of the remaining 13 million acres of wilderness. I have no magic figure, I will probably support the Conservationist&#39;s Alternative when it comes out this fall, at least as a minimum. I would say, just throwing out a possible split of that 9 million acres, if we make 4 million more of it available for timber harvest and designate 5 million of it for wilderness, that would seem to me to be overly generous to the timber industry. This would increase the total area available for timber harvest to 12 million acres and increase the total amount of protected wilderness to 9 million acres, which we could hope to save in perpetuity. I&#39;m opposed to release language, even soft release unless the bill, which it contains, contains also enough designated wilderness areas; and this would be a minimum of the Conservationst&#39;s Alter native which will be forumlated this fall. I support the endangered Idaho wilderness core of 10 areas and groups of areas, which you no doubt have heard the names of al ready. These include Mount Mallard-Larkins, Great Burn up North, White Cloud-Boulders, et cetera. I support also in eastern Idaho the following areas for wilderness in your bill.

Good morning, Senator. I&#39;m going to speak here this morning and I&#39;ll try to summarize this as much as I can. My name is Evan Tibbott. I&#39;m a resident of Idaho Falls and I&#39;ll just be testi  fying as an individual. I guess my main motivation for concern right now is what ap pears to me to be a repudiation of the progress that has been made over the past two decades in this country toward establishing some kind of balance in our management of natural resources. I&#39;m here today principally to testify in favor of the designation of Gams Mountain and Palisades roadless area as wilderness. My principal interest and familiarities with these two areas spans a period of approximateley 16 years, as the result of day hikes; I&#39;ve also taken cross-country skiing excursions recently in the last 2 years, ex tended tours in the Garns Mountain area in the winter. Together with friends I have also canoed and rafted the entire reach of the South Fork from near Swan Valley to Heise and beyond. I believe by reason of these experiences, as well as my general knowledge of the wildlife and natural character of the areas, I believe that they are suitable and should be included as wilderness. These two areas can be reached easily for day hikes by most resi dents of the Upper Snake River Valley. At the present time the designated wilderness, about 3.8 million acres, in this State is con centrated largely in the central portion. There are many people, I&#39;m sure, that would enjoy this kind of activity and experience who will find it difficult timewise, at least, to get into these areas. This is another reason why I favor these two areas that are close by a major population center of this State, for wilderness. I might mention where it comes to wildlife, the region includes mule deer, elk, moose, black bear, beaver, otter, pika, coyote, moun tain goats, bald and golden eagles. And on my own trips along the Snake River, I&#39;ve seen ospreys, night herons, and various species of water fowl. I consider it an ecological unit in itself. Timber values are generally low in the Garns Mountain area, except in the northern part of the region. The terrain is, for the most part, steep and difficult to penetrate with roads. The taxpayer subsidy to the timber industry, through costly road construction and road credits, becomes an extremely important issue when viewed in the context of resource tradeoffs such as wilderness op portunities forgone and loss of fish and wildlife habitat. And I ask, why is the Forest Service and apparently the adminis tration placing so much importance on timber sales nationwide  627     when there are approximately 40 billion, not million, but billion board feet of backlog sold of uncut timber, compared approximately to 1 billion board feet in Idaho? This 40 billion applies to most of the national forests. I&#39;d like to cite a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council, entitled, &#39;Giving Away the National Forests,&#39; which was made for the period years 1974 to 1978. The Caribou, Challis, Salmon, Saw tooth, and Targhee National Forests consistently lost money on timber sales. The Caribou Forest returned only 24 cents to the Treasury for each dollar spent on timber sales. This amounted to a total loss of $1,565,700 for the 5-year period.",,EVAN TIBBOTT,"IDAHO FALLS, IDAHO",Tibbott,Evan,h1d2,"tibbott, evan",Idaho Falls (CITY); Garns Mountain (LANDFORM); Palisades (LANDFORM); South Fork (STREAM); Swan Valley (CITY); Upper Snake River Valley (LANDFORM); Snake River (STREAM); Caribou (FOREST); Challis (CITY); Salmon (STREAM); Targhee National Forests (FOREST); Caribou Forest (FOREST),text

Kay",,Idaho Falls,"Idaho Falls, Idaho",f,"Ms. Snyder. Good morning, Senator. I am testifying as an indi vidual in support of 6 million acres of wilderness being included in the Idaho Forest Management Act, as wilderness. I am opposed to sacrificing wildlife habitat and back country streams to erosion from unnecessary and costly logging roads. Road construction, both directly and indirectly, threatens the ex istence of viable fish and game populations within these areas. Its direct effects include disturbance of wildlife populations, increased human access into these wild areas, and stream siltation due to steep slopes and unstable soils. Indirectly, road construction, by far the most expensive item in the Forest Service budget, uses money which could be used for fish and wildlife habitat improvement. Road construction costs are so high that in the areas of the coun try it costs the Forest Service more to provide access to the timber than the agency receives in payment for the sale of this timber. During the years 1974 to 1978, the Caribou, Challis, Salmon, Saw tooth, and Targhee National Forests consistently lost money on timber sales. The Sawtooth National Forest returned only 26 cents to the Treasury for each dollar spent on timber sales. The Caribou Forest returned only 24 cents. This is because of the high cost of road construction.  630  Taxpayer subsidy to the timber industry, through costly road construction and road credits, becomes and extremely improtant issue when viewed in the context of resource tradeoffs such as wil derness opportunities foregone and loss of fish and wildlife habitat. When road costs are considered it is often better for the Treasury to leave the timber where it is. It makes no sense to destroy an area&#39;s wilderness characteristics and pay to have it done. This is what the American taxpayers, owners of these resources, are doing. Please support wilderness in the Idaho Forest Management Act. This concludes my testimony.","Thank you very much.

Other than in Idaho Falls and building some houses over in Yellowstone, I went on a weekend backpacking trip in Cari bou National Forest just west of Palisades Reservoir in the Bear Creek roadless area. In 2 days up there we encountered motor bikes, hunters, horses, explosions, creeks full of mud from sheep trampling through them, high mountains with so much grazing I could hardly find the grass. Needless to say, we didn&#39;t see much wildlife up there, nor did we find much peace and quiet. And if this is the idea that the Forest Service has for multiple use, I think we  I have been out back packing, I have encountered sometimes fishermen, and I appreciate the fact that Idaho has some excellent wilderness areas where I can see a lot of wildlife; the hunting and fishing is good and I can generally find peace and quiet. But I think that&#39;s changing. A couple of years ago I took a back country trip into the Sawtooth Wilderness and saw more people and horses than anything else and experienced little, if any, solitude. In the River of No Return Wilderness every day there were over 100 people that began float trips down the Middle Fork during the season. As a recent article in Newsweek points out, Americans are descending upon wilder ness at a greater rate than ever. And one point seems clear to me, and this is, we need more wilderness. I&#39;ve urged the Senator to include in his legislation the endan gered Idaho wilderness core that&#39;s being proposed by conservation groups. This proposal includes two outstanding areas near Idaho Falls, the Garns Mountain wilderness area and the Palisades wil need a lot more wilderness in Idaho. When  638 area. The Garns Mountain Area is another one with an abundance of wildlife and excellent fishing or as a steep canyon country. The Palisades has excellent hiking trails and lots of wild life. Though there&#39;s been some controversy in the Palisades of oil and gas, none have been found there yet. In addition to the 10 areas proposed by the conservationists in their four proposals, I&#39;d like to comment on a couple of other road less areas in eastern Idaho. Just outside of Pocatello in Caribou Na tional Forest is a small roadless area, the West fork of the Main Creek. In deciding the source of water supplied to the Pocatello areas, I used a great deal of effort in day hiking and cross-country skiing just miles from Pocatello. This areas seems like an excellent candidate for wilderness. In other nearby roadless areas, Lionhead is north of Henry&#39;s Lake. This small roadless area up at Targhee is part of the Great Yellowstone Ecosystem and is a very important grizzly bear habitat. If you&#39;ve read the papers lately, you know the grizzly is in trouble, and wilderness designation can help save this part of his habitat. Last, I urge the Senator not to include the hard release language in his wilderness bill. By banning roadless areas from ever being considered for wilderness again, this language would eliminate the potential of future generations to enjoy these pristine wildlife lands. Deciding the fate today of tomorrows wilderness areas in Idaho seems to be shortsided at best to me.

Good morning, Senator, my name is Sandra Voelker, I&#39;m a resident of Idaho and I would like to speak for addi  tional wilderness this morning. I&#39;ve heard a lot of people this morning say that they have lived in Idaho for a great number of years and so have their families, and with a lot of the opinions stated, I can only say that it seems that familiarity breathes contempt. I was born in Nebraska. And in Nebraska the land is divided very neatly into squares, and we spend a lot of time dreaming     671  there. We go with with maps to the Western States and we plan our vacations. We look at those maps and we find the big areas of green; we don&#39;t look for the roads, we don&#39;t look for the real estate developments. We look for places to vacation, for places to get away. It was very important to me then, and it&#39;s still important to me now as an Idaho resident. This is a personal argument but, as you can see, it&#39;s also an economic argument. Tourism is a very im portant industry here. There are two ways to look at this situation. One of them is prac tical and economic, and I think that&#39;s been handled beautifully. The other one concerns the quality of the State and the quality of our lives as a result of how we treat that State. One argument I would like to address is one that I&#39;ve heard sev eral times, and that is, that wilderness is supposedly not for every one. It&#39;s being maintained for supposedly a very small percentage. I have heard the handicapped and the elderly mentioned as people who can&#39;t use the wilderness. I really don&#39;t know if the elderly and the handicapped would agree with that. I don&#39;t understand why, if that is the case, we have handicapped organizations who are orga nizing behind wilderness and behind their support for wilderness. It doesn&#39;t seem to make any sense, I think we&#39;re putting words in their mouths. There seem to be other rationale behind this argument. Probably part of it is economic, undoubtedly. It seems like the other part of it, perhaps, could be an excuse for some sort of indolence. I would like to know when it became so abhorrent to Americans to put out a little effort for their enjoyment. It looks to me like we have an argument here as the same kind of argument we have for network television, and look what that did to quality. There&#39;s nothing wrong with sweating a little bit to get something that&#39;s worthwhile; I think we&#39;d all benefit from it. To kind of summarize economic arguments, we&#39;ve got the timber and the mining industry saying that they need to earn the dollar today. They say we&#39;ll get some part of that dollar, I am not so con vinced. I would like to say that probably that dollar could be earned tomorrow if it&#39;s not earned today through some careful planning. The wilderness that we use unwisely today will never in its natural, original state be available to us again; that&#39;s a perma nent commitment. We are urged to act with expediency; we are urged to â€” it seems we are almost being urged to rush through this situation. In issues like that, often, things like morality, sensitivity, quality, and aes thetics get pushed aside. It seems like those kind of values are more basically American than economic gain, or at least maybe they should be. Also these things generally end up being counter productive, even economically.

Good morning Senators, my name is Scott Clay and I am speaking for myself. I&#39;m speaking also as a homeowner in  Idaho Falls, a resident of Idaho, and a staff Navy reactor operator at the Navy reactors facility. I might add, the wilderness areas and proposed areas are used and appreciated by a large number of the Navy people stationed here. I would also like to speak for wilderness. With the idealism char acteristic of most enlistees in this country&#39;s Armed Forces, I consid ered it important to do my bit protecting America. Now I must con sider the question: What kind of America do I wish to protect? My idea of America is a country with room to explore, enjoy, and leave unchanged, streams unpolluted due to logging roads, clear streams for trout, and water sources for wildlife of all kinds as well as for the human population. I did not wish to protect an America that plunders its resources for short-term gains. Conservation groups in Idaho have designated 10 endangered core areas, and it is imperative that these be protected, along with much of the remaining acreage. A recommendation should be made only after extensive and thoughtful studies have been completed. Hard release language has no place in any recommendation for wilderness in this State. We as eastern Idahoans must be even more vigilant than resi dents of central and northern Idaho. Our areas are already limited; we have nothing to squander. To give one example, Palisades is a range worth protecting, not just a troublesome stretch of road to cross on the way out of State. On a recent trip to the Gams Moun tain area, I was treated to a more extensive display of wild flowers than I have encountered in years of hiking. Wildlife abounds, and the most striking feature is the absence of man and any sign of his previous visits. This unspoiled beauty is too much to forfeit for doubtful economic gains. We are asked by the timber and mining industries to support a proposal which they say will bring revenues to local communities. Can they promise any appreciable success for any length of time? Their ventures are shaky, doubtful, and perhaps costly to us eco nomically as well as environmentally. Even if they could guarantee success, the environmental tradeoff is serious enough. In many of these marginal ventures, it becomes absurd. Our representatives must listen to Idaho&#39;s people, not financial interests, many of -those being out of State interests. The majority of Idaho&#39;s people want Idaho left Idaho. Industry must realize that there is no substitute for long-range planning. When the external costs become too great to justify the gain, alternatives must be explored and existing sources more fully utilized. The people of Idaho will not pay for this lack of planning with their heritage. Thank you.","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen,

I&#39;m speaking as a private citizen and although I&#39;m not a member of any special interest group and I neither hunt  nor fish, Idaho is a land I&#39;ve come to greatly appreciate these 8 years that I&#39;ve lived here. I hope that Idaho can maintain the qual ity of life that the people now enjoy. It takes many years for God to build a wilderness and only moments for man to wreck a wilder ness through foolishness or mismanagement. If we do lose a wilder ness, do we really know the impact on the environment when a wilderness disappears? Thus, I oppose a hard release of the roadless areas and support as a minimum the designation of the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core, the Italian Peaks, Lionhead, Diamond Peak, Bear Creek, and Borah Peak as wilderness. The above named areas are excellent havens for many big game animals such as cougar, bighorn sheep, bear, elk, and also eagles. Human intrusion with roads and attendant activities will reduce the habitat of these animals. Just the aesthetic value of these ani mals is worth preserving in a pristine state to let them roam as free as possible. Many of these areas are not practical for logging either. Rugged terrain complicates roadbuilding. Furthermore, is the Forest Serv ice going to continue their unwise fiscal practice of constructing roads in an area when their revenues for timber sales are less than the cost of the roads? I would rather my tax subsidy support educa tion. Because of the fragile nature of much of the Idaho topsoil and steep terrain in these areas, increased erosion is also a real possi bility with the intervention of roads. Water quality is much superi or in roadless watershed areas as opposed to areas with roads. Also, increased siltation is a likelihood that reduces fish spawning grounds, and these can&#39;t be recovered. Also, how much wilderness will be destroyed before the oil and gas companies conclude that there are no resources to exploit here in eastern Idaho? Isn&#39;t several years long enough to conclude there are no resources to exploit? Is the destruction of wilderness worth the price for only hypothetical oil and gas? If we continue to lose wilderness in such pristine areas as those mentioned, will Chief Seattle&#39;s words to President Franklin Pierce in 1855 prove to be prophetic words? And these are his words: The whites too shall pass, perhaps sooner than other tribes. Continue to contami nate your bed and you will one night suffocate in your own waste. When the buffalo are all slaughtered, the wild horses all tamed, the secret corners of the forest heavy with the scent of many men, and the view of the ripe hills blotted by talking wires, where is the thicket? Gone. Where is the eagle? Gone. And what is it to say goodbye to the swift and the hunt, the end of living and the beginning of survival.","Thank you.

On a national scale wilderness is a scarce and precious commodity and will increase in value in the future. I particularly oppose the enactment of what is referred to as hard release legislation, which would preclude further consider ation of wilderness classification for any areas so designated. I do not believe it imperative to rush into irrevocable decisions of this  kind. We hear a great deal about economic impacts. It is well known that many logging roads cost the taxpayers more than the value of associated timber. The public should not be required to subsidize the destruction of our public lands. Cessation of further Federal funding for logging roads would be a useful measure to take in con nection with public-land management policy. A conservative approach to the disposition of our natural re sources demands that radical changes be viewed with skepticism, and my changes be treated with caution. Please do not enact any measures which will lead to the unnecessary destruction of our re maining wild lands. Thank you for the opportunity to make these remarks.","Thank you.

Yes, Garney Hardy.  Because I am not able as part of my job to spend time collecting data and organizing it to support my views, I am going to speak in more general terms as a resident of Idaho who is concerned about the direction we are taking. From some testimony one would assume the timber industry is Idaho&#39;s largest, almost only, industry. Timber alone should not de termine Idaho&#39;s future. There is a large supply of sold, uncut timber. The housing industry is in a slump and recent rises in the prime indicate that the lower interest rates necessary for recovery are not going to happen soon. There has not been a lot of mention of the need to protect the land, particularly in its function as watershed. The trees will grow back in places, the game will probably return, but silted streams will not recover and eroded land cannot be replaced. In so much of the area under discussion no oil and gas have been found; the timber is of marginal quality, the topography is rugged and the soil erodes easily. To argue that designation of an area as wilderness causes it to be more heavily used proves that we in fact have insufficient wilder ness areas. The demand is there and it is hoped that Idaho will be spared the destruction caused by the pursuit of the almighty dollar that has ruined California and Colorado.     678  We are apparently willing to spend million of dollars and use large quantities of natural resources to build football stadiums, bowling alleys, and shopping centers. To spend a portion of our re sources by not using them seems to be considered a sacrilege. One suspects that the Reagan administration is against the designation of new wilderness areas because its major constituency, the busi ness community, has been unable to find a way to make wilderness as profitable as football. I support wilderness designation for the areas specified in the Endangered Idaho Core. In addition, I support wilderness designa tion for areas I know personally, the Boulder-White Clouds, the Garns Mountain, Palisades, and the Pioneers. These are already popular areas, heavily used for recreation, where development would not be compatible with established use. Palisades and Garns Mountain are closest unroaded, undeveloped areas to the urban centers of Idaho Falls and Pocatello. They are extremely popular with hikers, hunters, horseback riders, and fisherman. A popula tion center in an area where people are outdoor oriented needs to have close-by wilderness to satisfy the recreational needs of the residents. INEL contractors are among the largest employers in this State. In order to attract the qualified employees they need to come to Idaho, the quality of life in Idaho, including the opportuni ties for wilderness recreation, are stressed in their recruiting. This should also be taken into account. If I wanted to make a large salary, I would not stay in Idaho. I&#39;m here because of the quality of life. Last, I feel there is no need to freeze up forever from wilderness designation, lands which are not so designated now. Thank you.","Thank you. I&#39;m sorry we had your name wrong

Aug-11-1983,aug-11-1983-west-phillip-b,,,"West, Phillip B.",,Idaho Falls,"Idaho Falls, Idaho",m,"Mr. West. I also appreciate the opportunity to speak here today, and I must comment on a misconception. I came here, well, con cerning grazing rights, I was not under the impression that they were allowed in wilderness areas. Therefore, I have to pose a rhe torical question in that if grazing is permitted in wilderness areas and the environmental impact that exists will continue from graz ing, then I wonder what the effect of the wilderness area really is. Undeveloped areas exist due to a lack of demand for their re     sources. The demand for resources is therefore an economic issue,  and wilderness area development affects this demand. We all pay for the natural resources provided by our forests. When we harvest lumber, mine for minerals, graze livestock, and cut firewood, we all benefit through reduced costs in consumer goods. Similarly, when we use our forests for recreation, we benefit from these activities. Unfortunately, none of these benefits come cheap. The presence of man in forests is believed to take a toll on the ecology that may affect the forest and its wildlife in the future. The type of activity will often determine the degree of impact, but as long as man is present, some type of impact will exist. Economic conflicts exist in forest development just as in the mar ketplace. Any commercial development may cost scenic beauty, and recreational opportunities can impede industrial activity. As long as a demand for a resource exists, there will be conflict. With in creased availability of forest resources there will be a reduction in concentrated demand and conflicts. Segregation of resource is not the answer. If we hold a particular area open for intense lumber harvest, the environmental impact of that area will be great, due to concentrated one-type usage. One area cannot efficiently supply all market areas and therefore will increase consumer costs. Segregation of one resources development will also disrupt the development of other resources in that area and cause concentrated development of those resources in other areas.  Wilderness areas are examples of poor economic plannng. Wil areas segregate resource development and create concen trated usage in other areas. They also have environmental impacts associated with their type of resource development. Transportation through the area is slow, causing longer duration of human impact on wildlife and ecology. Other costs exist due to trying to find sub stitute resource development areas. There are also lost opportunity costs associated with wilderness areas; there will be no grazing permits, no mineral rights leased, no income of any type. The limited recreational activities allowed in wilderness areas are rarely able to support themselves. Off-road vehicle funds help maintain and develop trail systems. Snowmobile stamps help maintain groomed trails and parking areas. These in dividuals or groups who promote wilderness areas neither have the resources nor the desire to support their own activities, financially or with volunteer labor. Trail and road maintenance is a necessary derness     697  part of ORV, four-wheel drive, grazing, and lumbering activities. We all will benefit from these voluntary efforts. Not all of Idaho&#39;s forests are being utilized or developed for any particular use. The wilderness area laws, which restrict freedom, have contributed only party to the amount of undeveloped areas. The other undeveloped land remains undeveloped due to lack of demand. These undeveloped areas cost us nothing because the eco nomic opportunities and recreational opportunities are still there and there is no forced segregation. As a result, there is also no con centrated or one-type usage. Usage will be diverse and dispersed, having the least environmental impact and the least cost. It would seem that wilderness areas have the greatest cost and the fewest benefits. The concept of wilderness areas maintaining land in its natural state, even at great costs, is a pleasent thought, but the attempt is futile because the presence and impact of man is unavoidable. To examine any benefits that may exist due to wilderness areas we must examine those who do benefit. Who are they? They can&#39;t be people who supply the rest of us with goods and services, be cause wilderness areas don&#39;t allow this. They aren&#39;t strict environ mentalists, because they promote activities that do allow man&#39;s presence in the forest. Multiple use supporters are often environ mentalists in that they are equally concerned with the environ ment. Multiple use supporters are often involved in environmental cleanup efforts such as trash cleanup, erosion control, and erosion cleanup. Wilderness area promoters are also not supporters of rec reational opportunities because wilderness areas outlaw many forms of recreational activities. The supporters of wilderness areas are members of a small fac tion who strive to eliminate competition for forest resources that they wish to exploit in their own unique way. This exploitation will however be at the expense of everyone else s rights, privileges, and economic well-being.  Thank you.","Thank you very much. I wish to thank all the

Thank you very much for letting me testify here  I live southwest of town here on a farm, which I grew up on and have operated for a good part of those years. It&#39;s back by the Hells Half Acre lava flow, which is essentially somewhat of a wil derness. And since very early in my life, I explored this lava flow and grown to appreceiate the values of wild lands. I realy feel like wilderness is misunderstood by a lot of people as a scientific and ecological phenomenon. And when I was at Brigham Young University, I had a professor there, Dr. Earl Christensen, probably one of the foremost ecology â€” plant ecology profes sors in the Western States. And he took us through a lot of the areas in Utah, and also exposed us to the writings of early explor ers in the area, white explorers, and their journals of exactly what sort of flora and fauna existed in the early time as contrary to pop ular myths, showed that this land was not an empty and desolate and a dry place that it was portrayed that the settlers come to, but it was a very lush, very abundant, beautiful ecosystem here, that in Salt Lake Valley at that time they used to lose their cattle be cause the grass was so tall they would get lost in it, they couldn&#39;t find them out there. The fact is, that if you compare a balance of nature climax eco system to any man-influenced ecosystem, agriculture or preclimax or postclimax, that in every case you&#39;ll find that in the climax bal  today.  709  ance of nature ecosystem, you will have a greater percentage of the Sun&#39;s energy captured through photosynthesis, you will have a greater number of species present, you will have a greater number  of  symbiotic  relationships  or  organisms  working  together  for  mutual advantage. You will have greater stability, greater com plexity, greater diversity, and less entropy or degradation of that  energy.     And I feel like on this basis that wilderness is highly qualified to be given first priority.",,DAVID A.

Yes; I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;m supposed to take, by the way. Four minutes, thank you. As I understand it, we&#39;re here today to decide what to do with extra lands as far as wilderness designation in Idaho. This issue has gone on far too  717  long, and I&#39;d like to see it â€” and I&#39;m speaking as just a personal tax payer here, no side to take here. But I would really like to see this issue settled once and for all. Most importantly, I&#39;d like to see it settled for the average citizen, and not for a special interest group on either side of the issue. In a country with a growing population, setting aside land for a small minority of people does not make sense.     On one side of the issue are the environmental groups who want to lock up everything. These groups say that we must lock up land for our children and their children&#39;s children so that each genera tion will be able to enjoy the mountains, lakes, and forests. As a parent I want this too, this is a fine goal. On the other side of the issue are the commercial interests that need the land to produce lumber, minerals, and to provide grazing. As a consumer, I don&#39;t want to have to pay more for these products than necessary. So the only logical alternative to this issue of wilderness designation is multiple use of the land. We presently have a Government agency well equipped to care for our public lands, the U.S. Forest Service. The Forest Service has done a fine job of providing access to all  land user groups, and let&#39;s give them due credit for that now and ask, why should it be any different in the future? True, some groups in the Forest Service may have prejudices which affect their decisions for or against a particular form of recreation or com merce, but as a whole the system works well. Environmental impact statements provide a very effective way of curtailing any misuses which do occur. I&#39;d like to give an example of probably how much the wilderness people use if we were to set aside a lot of this land. Our national parks in Yellowstone, if you drive along the highway there, you will see thousands and thousands of people enjoying the sites. You take a daylong hike, say 1 to 3 miles, one way, you may still see dozens of people enjoying themselves. But if you take a hike of a longer distance, say 8 to 10 miles, which is more typical a length that is required for wilderness use, the number of people drop to a handful. By the way, this is a very popular park and millions of people and visitors who have come each year have not destroyed it yet. Further, if we are to believe environmental groups, animals cannot exist side by side with man, for example, along Yellowstone Park&#39;s paved highway, where elk and buffalo are common sights there. Wise use of our lands through multiple use is the only fair and reasonable way to use our public forests. High quality backcountry can be maintained for all recreational users, while at the same time providing access to public lands for commercial users. Wilder ness advocates who want to limit access and use of public lands are every bit as selfish as a careless industrial user who damages the land for an extra buck. I would like to urge the use of multiple use and please keep our lands open for the people.",,BRUCE SCOTT ANDERSON,"IDAHO FALLS, IDAHO",Anderson,Bruce Scott,h1d2,"anderson, bruce scott",Yellowstone (FOREST); Yellowstone Parks (FOREST); Wilderness (WILDERNESS),text

Senator McClure, my name is Dick Curtis, I live in Idaho Falls. I would like to go on record as supporting the 1978 citi zen&#39;s alternative W as a minimum area for wilderness designation. Idaho is blessed with unique wilderness areas that every year draw  increasing numbers of tourists to the State. I feel that the tourist industry is now and will remain far more important from an eco nomic standpoint than those timber and mineral resources that might be extracted through a one-shot destruction of these wilder ness areas. Not only would development of these areas destroy the fish and wildlife habitat, but subsequently the resource itself which all Idahoans now take pride in. Wilderness is rapidly diminishing in the lower 48 States and will soon become a commodity with rap idly increasing value as present and future generations seek out the recreational values offered by these remaining areas. A second point I feel very strongly about is the use of taxpayers money to develop roads to provide access to timber sales by private lumber companies. Often the cost of these roads exceeds the value of the timber harvested. I would like to go on record as strongly opposing the use of tax dollars by the Forest Service to subsidize the lumber industry. I have consistently voted for fiscal conserv atism in the leadership of this country and this State. I, therefore, request that the Senators and Representatives representing Idaho in the Congress of the United States live up to their promises of being fiscally conservative and responsible. Finally, I would urge that 10 key areas be given immediate pro-, tection as an Idaho Core Wilderness. These areas are Long CanyonSelkirk Crest, Mallard-Larkins, Great Burn-Cayuse Creek, Payette Crest, Sawtooth Completion, White Cloud-Boulder Mountains, Northern Lemhis, Palisades, Garns Mountain, and Salmo-Priest. I have personally explored most of these areas and can attest to their excellent wilderness characteristics. I feel, in preparing a wilderness bill to protect the areas men tioned throughout this statement, you should not include any lan  726 guage that would permanently ban any future wilderness consider ation for any areas not classified now.

I&#39;m here. Senator McClure and committee members, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to express my views on the future use of Federal lands in Idaho. I agree that decisions concerning the management of these unde veloped areas could determine if Idaho is to be the Appalachia of the 21st century or have a stable, growing, high quality environ ment where value is added through the application of technical ex pertise, not the depletion of natural resources. As a computer software engineer, I place a high value on the proximity of nature&#39;s wilderness to my place of employment. The existence of wilderness enhances the quality of life in Idaho. Many others hold these same beliefs, in particular many techni cal professionals. Companies in various parts of the country at tempt to capitalize on their environments. I collected some profes sional employment advertisements from two periodicals directed at electronic and computer professionals. These advertisements de scribe the high quality environment and recreational opportunities a potential employee would find. One such ad, for a company in Tennessee, states, &#39;You&#39;ll be in spired by our spectacular surroundings â€” the great Smoky Moun tains and the awesome Cherokee National Forest.&#39; How much more impressive are the Lemhi&#39;s, Pioneer&#39;s, and White Clouds? Another described Phoenix, Ariz., as &#39;One of the Nation&#39;s fastestgrowing, high technology centers.&#39; Having recently lived in Phoenix for 6 years, I can attest to this fact. I would like to point out that the Superstition Wilderness Area is only 20 miles outside Phoenix. The addition of the Big Holes, Garns Mountain area to Idaho wilderness can only help the quality of life in Idaho Falls. This quality of life will help attract and retain high technology industry. The depletion and extraction industries provide boom/bust, low growth economies. I don&#39;t want to see the Forest Service subsidize these industries. I would much rather see the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources provide incentives for the develop ment and training of people: a renewable resource.  729  A conservative approach should be taken when dealing with the very long time constants of nature. In the case of wilderness desig nation, the conservative approach also represents the lowest cost to the people of the United States. The management resolution  which  insures the best economic     return from these valuable wilderness resources is the preservation and simple conservation of these roadless areas. I urge you to protect roadless areas with wilderness designation. The potential long-term benefits of this decision far outway the short-term profits which only a few will obtain through a nearterm harvest subsidized by taxpayers through Forest Service road  building. I want to continue these discussions. Man can&#39;t decide in one short period of time to dispose what has taken nature ages to pro vide. I m opposed to the hard release wording.

Aug-11-1983,aug-11-1983-chew-eddie-w,,,"Chew, Eddie W.",,Idaho Falls,"Idaho Falls, Idaho",m,"Mr. Chew. Senator McClure, ladies and gentleman, my name is Eddie Chew. My interest in wilderness is as the past president of the Snake River Audubon Society, someone who enjoys wildlife, and in recent years a has-been wilderness hiker, having done so with a boy scout troop elsewhere. First I would like to set the record straight on one point. I understand that an earlier witness said that the National Audubon Society encourages the leasing of our sanctuaries. National Audubon doesn&#39;t encourage such leasing; it is occasionally considered. National Audubon sanctuaries are not managed as wilderness, so that this question of roading roadless areas is not an issue there. Our one sizable lease on the Paul J. Rainey sanctuary predates Audubon ownership of that land. I would like to thank you very much for holding these hearings in Idaho, Senator, and first I would like to make a few general comments on wilderness statewide. I submit that we should be focusing not on how much more land is designated as wilderness, but on how much of our valuable for ests, now unroaded, are allowed to slip away from the wilderness character they now possess. Let me emphasize that these lands are now wilderness but not yet so designated. Our choice is whether to protect them for the use and enjoyment of future generations or to allow them to be degraded to satisfy the short-term desires of some of our people. I say that if the decision is close, we should opt for protection. Congress can reverse itself if a clear national need for a particular wilderness area is shown. Congress cannot make a roaded, clearcut, or a surface-mined area wilderness again. I would, therefore, urge Congress to allow not more than half of the remain ing 6.5 million acres of roadless forest areas in Idaho to be degrad ed to nonwilderness status. Specific areas will be discussed later.  32-426  0â€” 84  47     730  I would like to see a strong wilderness system to retain most of the multiple uses of our forests. Of the six major forest uses â€” min erals, timber, grazing, recreation, wildlife, and watershed â€” four would continue in wilderness areas. On the other hand, I can imag ine very few multiple uses on a clearcut or in an open-pit mine. As a member of an Idaho fish and game advisory committee, I would especially urge that the 559 thousand acres identified as crit ical to wildlife be included as wilderness. The Borah Peak area of 120 thousand acres is so designated. As you state, Senator McClure, much time and effort has been spent studying roadless areas. But the Forest Service recommenda tions have been shortchanged in your recent questionnaire. In addi tion to the 1 million acres proposed as wilderness by the Forest Service, 641,000 acres, most of it in this area, were designated for further planning. I believe most of that designation hinged on oil and gas potential. After 4 more years, I think I&#39;m correct that we still have no producing wells in eastern Idaho.","Thank you, Mr. Chew, your time has expired.
Your statement will be placed in the record.

Thank you, sir. I want to thank you for the opportuni  ty to express my views here. Although everyone seems to disagree with the results of RARE II â€” prowilderness wants to quite a bit  741  antiwilderness wants far less â€” I do hope Senator McClure is not ignoring the outstanding efforts and results of Rare II. If the Senator is interested in his constituents&#39; opinions, a close     more while  look at the Rare II report would be quite interesting. Idaho citizens supplied 44,000 inputs with 54,000 signatures. Here we are again. I do regret time restrictions do not permit evening sessions so the site and other workers could attend; I&#39;m sure they&#39;d want to spend another 8 hours here to give testimony. RARE El&#39;s evening session in Idaho Falls drew a packed house at the University Place auditorium which holds over 300 people. The RARE II study was performed by professional Forest Service per sonnel who are knowledgeable in timber and mining evaluation. My understanding is lands with known or suspected deposits or marketable timber were excluded from consideration. This means RARE II was already a comprise and not a Carter wish list. I feel the citizens of Idaho have given a great deal of time and effort into RARE II, which hopefully won&#39;t be overruled in these short few meetings. The people of Idaho have repeatedly shown a desire for additional wilderness. One of the arguments against additional wilderness has been the economic impact of removing Federal lands from multiple use. A month ago I heard an Idaho Falls radio announcer comment that the State of Idaho spent $60,000 in the Salt Lake area on vacation ing in Idaho. The same broadcast stated tourism is the second larg est industry in Idaho. According to the Idaho State Economic and Community Affairs Division, agriculture is first with tourism, mining, manufacturing, and timber too close to call for second. Last year a forest ranger at Sun Valley counted over 100 groups on a Sunday afternoon hiking in a nearby wilderness. There is no doubt that wilderness areas are becoming major tourist attractions. I would like to see the results of RARE II implemented with ad ditional acreages added to make the total closer to 2.3 million. To that end, I support the Idaho fish and game additional requests. I would also like to support Garns Mountain, Borah Peak, and the Palisades area. But, most of all, I would like to support Wyoming for wilderness status for the west slope of the Tetons. It may be Wyoming, but Idaho kind of lays claim to that area. I hope Senator McClure will be able to support one of Idaho&#39;s largest industries by adding the excellent work already started by RARE II. Thank you.",Thank you. Joel Case.,ALLAN C.

Please do not include hard release language in Senator McClure&#39;s bill. I would like those lands which are roadless at the start of the next forest planning cycle to be studied again for wil derness.  I would like wilderness designation for the following reasons: I personally have enjoyed wilderness/roadless areas as a backpacker, cross-country skier, mountain climber, rafter, and as a fire lookout. I want my son to enjoy the same. Another reason is natural diver sity, also water quality. There is a higher quality of water, of un disturbed watersheds, for fish, for unsilted gravel beds that are needed for spawning grounds for salmon and trout, for wildlife, for research, recreational diversity, recreational economics. Factors besides numbers of raw acres need to be looked at. We should look at specific ecosystems we want to leave for future gen erations. We need to protect rare ecosystems, not just rocks and ice  744  should be designated wilderness, not just all snowbound areas, but areas accessible in springtime. We should consider individual areas.  Areas that I would like included are Diamond Peak. I have hiked high up on this mountain. It has seven wilderness species identified by the Forest Service Bighorn sheep have been reintroduced, and bighorn sheep need undeveloped lands to survive. It has very mar ginal timber value and site productivity. It does have archeological value. The Forest Service has given it a wilderness attribute rating     system  of 22.  Borah Peak, I have backpacked and climbed in this area. It is very high mountain country. It has scrub forest and no timber value and no mineral value. Northern Lemhi, I have backpacked many of the lakes with an exlumberman who said the timber value was very marginal. It has very fragile meadows and deep forests, excellent hiking, fishing, and hunting.

Aug-11-1983,aug-11-1983-dibello-ed,,,"Dibello, Ed",,Idaho Falls,"Idaho Falls, Idaho",m,"Mr. DiBello. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, Senator. My name is Ed DiBello. I am a registered mechanical en gineer in the State of Idaho. I have resided in the intermountain west for the past 20 years and have been a resident of Idaho for the past 10. I live with my family in the Western States by choice. The  area, Idaho in particular, offers unparallelled recreational opportu nities. Idaho and the West stand at a crossroad. We can easily take the path to more development and less wilderness. I favor the path toward increased wilderness designation. The fact that Idaho, with 3.8 million acres of designated wilderness, has the largest wilder ness system in the lower 48 States should be a source of pride. The fact that we wish to place more land into the wilderness designa tion reflects well on the foresight of the residents of the State. We must conserve the lands and our resources for the future. Idaho is a unique State that should not repeat the failures and mistakes of other States. We have the opportunity to plan our future, conserve our resources, and leave a legancy of responsible land management for future residents. You may ask why an engineer, who develops and builds, comes down on the side of wilderness? The key factor is trust. I do not trust the current administration, nor future administrations, nor resource developers to be good stewards of the land if they are not regulated, pressured, or otherwise made to be good stewards. If we repeat our past and turn our prime watersheds into waste lands, we all will lose. The western ecology is a fragile one; this has been demonstrated many times. A compromise on wilderness areas may be necessary, and this hearing process may well result in com promise. However, I support maximizing the lands designated for wilderness in the State. I would rather err on the side of conserva tion than on the side of overdevelopment and exploitation. Thank you.  Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

Being an avid hunter, hiker, skier, nature photographer, the largest expanse of pristine wild areas have attracted me to Idaho. Having had much in my graduate training in college, I recognize that these areas not only allow myself and others to be a part of an undisturbed, natural Rope.  community, but also provide the necessary requirements for these communities to continue; that is, a solitude from man&#39;s machinery and noises. The approximate 6.5 million acres of roadless areas under consideration, I support the recommendations by a number of conservation groups that a minimum of 50 percent of this acre ages be designated as wilderness. Included areas should be the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core the conservationists will oppose in detail in October. I would also  751  like to see included the Diamond Peak, Mount Naomi, Warm Creek, Bear Creek, Italian Peaks, and the southern portion of the  Pahsimeroi areas. I have hiked or have hunted much of the Palisades, Garns Moun tain and the Bear Creek and White Clouds areas, and have found them quite worthy of wilderness designation. All these areas in clude wildlife habitat and some magnificent scenery. In addition, several of these areas are close to the population in southeast Idaho. It has been suggested that Idaho already has enough wilder ness and needs no more. With that, I can&#39;t agree. I have hiked in the Sawtooths and River of No Return wildernesses a number of times. On each occasion I&#39;ve been amazed and concerned by the number of people or horses seen there. This is certainly not an in dication of enough wilderness, but, rather, that more needs to be designated.     The economic reasons for not wanting more wilderness does not seem substantiated, either. In terms of timber sales, there is pres ently a 3-year, 40-billion board feet backlog of timber nationwide; 1billion board feet backlog in Idaho alone. Also, according to the study of the National Resource Defense Council, the Challis, Salmon, Sawtooth, and Targhee National Forests consistently lost money on timber sales from 1974 through 1978. Other sources indi cate that deficit sales continued in Targhee National Forest. There is, however, an economic reason to increase the wilderness area, that being tourism, which is, from what I understand, the second largest income producer in the State. Certainly one of the reasons the people are coming to Idaho are its vast wild and scenic areas. Let&#39;s make sure we continue to have them. In addition, I urge you not to include hard release language in your legislation. Instead, include soft release language which will allow current roadless areas to continue roadless at the start of the next forest planning cycle. The importance of an intact ecosystem cannot be overemphasized, not only for the benefit of future gen erations to explore, study, and enjoy, but also, and primarily, for the benefit of the communities residing there. Let us not miss the opportunity to set aside enough wild America for increasing numbers of people that would want the opportunity to experience for themselves the way this country as a whole once was.","Thank you very much.

I enjoy backpacking and other wilderness-related ac tivities in the Boulder/White Clouds, the Lemhis, the Beaverhead Mountains, Burns Canyon in the Garns Mountain area, and the Lionhead area on Targhee Pass. Opening these and other areas for development will jeopardize areas critical to the wildlife popula tion, degrade stream quality, and deprive people of wilderness recreation. Allowing roads to be built in these areas will increase soil erosion and stream siltation, reduce desirable habitat for large     752  animals, and ruin the quality of the wilderness for our children. Once a wilderness is destroyed, you can&#39;t put it back. I am opposed to the negative economic benefit realized by timber sale in these areas. Installing roads to log timber when it costs more to build the road than the timber is worth is economically stupid. I would rather see my tax dollars spent for education. I cannot support the philosophy of destroying pristine wilderness areas merely to subsidize the logging industry. I also oppose the hard release language for excluded areas of the wilderness proposal, whereby areas excluded from wilderness desig nation would be forever barred from further consideration. Past legislation, which allowed reconsideration following a 15-year plan ning cycle, is much more sensible. This type of language is particu larly important for areas like Palisades, which have potential for oil and gas production. I cannot support the elimination of these areas for further consideration, especially when oil and gas remov al may not be economical. Hopefully, we are not planning to use our tax dollars to subsidize oil companies, too. I specifically support wilderness recommendations for the Endan gered Idaho Wilderness Core because the wildlife habitat of these 10 areas is especially threatened by industrial interests. I also sup port wilderness recommendations for Lionhead, Italian Peaks, Borah Peak, and Diamond Peak roadless areas, from personal ob servation and enjoyment.

Senator, Mr. Symms, I&#39;m Les Stone, a  self-employed, small businessman and politically a conservative. I would like to encourage you to take a protectionist stand on many of our roadless areas. Protecting these areas and saving them for the future is just like putting money in the bank. They&#39;ll always be there if we decide later that we have to cut down the last tree or dig out the last bit of ore from the ground. Then we can always exploit the last elk habitat or run off the last grizzly bear or fill the last trout stream with silt. In the meantime, protecting these areas means protecting the habitat of Idaho&#39;s wildlife. It means protecting an environment that provides a lifestyle that can only be found in Idaho. If we only save half of our roadless areas as wilderness, that&#39;s only an additional 3.2 million acres. That still leaves 66 percent of the national forests in Idaho available for multiple use. Surely the cattlemen and the foresters, and miners can get along with 14 mil lion acres of forests. Senator, you&#39;re going to be making decisions that will have a permanent, nonreversible effect on our environment. Just look back 100 years when the buffalo and salmon were considered an inexhaustible resource. The decisions that were made almost exter minated both of those species. The greatest amount of pressure always comes from those who are only interested in the short-term, financial gain. It takes cour age and foresight to resist that pressure and preserve some of the natural beauty for our great-grandchildren. I would hope that future generations will be proud of us and thankful for reserving wildlife habitat in its natural state, the way God made it. Other wise, Senator, your grandchildren may ask you why you didn&#39;t help protect Idaho so that they could see and enjoy some of the same country that you can enjoy today. The resource commodities that people are wanting to take from these areas will only become more valuable with time. Let&#39;s post pone opening these areas up to big business for 100 years or so. In the mean time, the animals that depend on these areas for their habitat will thank you. Those of us that love Idaho because of its unique beauty will thank you. And, as the rest of the country be comes more overrun, your grandchildren will certainly thank you for saving some of this natural beauty for them. And I thank you, Senator.","Thank you.

However, I&#39;m an agricultural engineer, and I&#39;m training in the wise use of natural resources, at least in terms of agricultural production. And I urge you to include most of the remaining roadless areas in the wilder ness system because I think that that&#39;s really the best use of these areas. The erosion effects I am familiar with from study in the classroom and observing in the field can destroy the fishery habi tats, and these are in the most part very fragile areas. Really, keeping it roadless, keeping it as wilderness, is not really a change; it&#39;s just keeping it in its present undisturbed state. So, really, in conclusion, I urge you to consider the long-term future and keep Idaho a great place to live and also to visit for our tour ists.

Thank you. Senator, members of the panel, I&#39;m Wil Dr. liam P. Rogers, a veterinarian from here in Idaho Falls. My family and I have lived here almost 15 years and have had the pleasure of hiking, backpacking, and horsebacking to several of the areas under consideration here today. Specifically they are the White Cloud/Boulder Mountain areas, the Northern Lemhis, Palisades, and the Gams Mountain areas. I would like to point out that none of these were expensive guid ing trips; we did all of this on our own, using our own equipment and own skills. We enjoyed the wide variety of wildlife and catch ing a few native trout from streams and being able to drink from generally unpolluted sources. But, most of all, we enjoy the solitude that undeveloped country provides. And solitude to me is probably the most important need that wilderness can fulfill for modern man. Our present-day lifestyle makes very strenuous demands upon all of us, and many of us need wilderness experience to re fresh our minds, our bodies, and our souls. I&#39;d like to point out that in just 200 years our country has gone from a country of total wilderness to our present state. Our forests were cut, our prairies were plowed, and, as a consequence, wildlife habitat and the numbers were greatly reduced. Our rivers were damaged and the spawning runs of salmon and steelhead either disappeared forever or were greatly reduced. We have rushed to supply man&#39;s every conceivable material need, but we have done so with little regard for man&#39;s spiritual needs.  Forty years ago my home State of Louisiana was a sportsman&#39;s paradise. But widespread oil and timber develpment has changed all of that. Many streams and rivers now have a thin film of oil on their surface, most game fish are gone, and those that remain are unfit to eat. Large chunks of residue from chemicals and detergent foul the sandbars in the river. I don&#39;t want to see that happen to Idaho&#39;s few remaining road less areas. I don&#39;t believe the majority of Idahoans are willing to sacrifice those lands which so enhance our quality of life for a few more jobs, for a few more barrels of oil, or for a few more board feet of lumber. Wilderness is like virginity; once it is gone, it is gone forever. Senator, I urge you to protect Idaho&#39;s roadless land during the forthcoming legislation. At least 50 percent of this area, including all the endangered Idaho wilderness core, should be put into our wilderness system as soon as possible. I favor the soft-release language so that in the future additional lands may be included. Idaho s in a unique position of being able to preserve some truly wild country for the benefit and use of all Americans. I believe we will take advantage of this opportunity.

Over the past several years I have attended  many meetings concerning the use of our national forests. These have delt mainly with Idaho, or nearby Montana and Wyoming. During these meetings I have heard many thoughtful, well-pre pared, even eloquent statements concerning wilderness areas in these States. So many concerned citizens have spent a lot of time preparing a defense for our diminishing wild and scenic areas. It continues to amaze me how hard the general public has to pursue the cause of protecting our public lands. Once again we are presented with the opportunity to express our views. As I have already stated, the many reasons for assuring these wilderness areas have been presented so well, so many times, I have little to offer. However, it is obvious that the public must once again fight diligently for the preservation of our wilderness     areas.  Who must we defend our wilderness against? Apparently we must defend these areas against the forest industry that is making a concerted effort to maintain their high-subsidy living from the taxpayers. Statements during this meeting, as well as previous pub lications, will again show that we are subsidizing the timber com panies to harvest marginal timber resources. At the same time, we are causing severe damage to wildlife and fishery habitats and rap idly depleting our remaining wilderness areas. We shouldn&#39;t have to do this again, but here we are, urging you to again consider the many good reasons for preserving these areas, even though some are only piles of rock, while others may be basins with alpine lakes and groves of trees. If we were to incor porate the remaining roadless areas of the national forest into the wilderness system, we would probably still have less than 20 per cent of our forest land protected. And surely we all know that this 20 percent would be mostly nonproductive or marginal in terms of forest products, since that is all that remains. However, this small remaining portion of our forest can still be very productive in terms of wildlife and fishery habitats. I have come to this meeting today to urge you to again consider including the remaining RARE II roadless areas of Idaho into the wilderness system. No compromise should be made with the forest industries who are trying to get these areas excluded from the wil derness system. Also, no hard-release language should be written concerning these areas. What we need now from our Senator is a strong declaration for our remaining wilderness, and then to see our Senators and Governor carry forward a program to see that this declaration is carried out.

Thank you, Senator. I&#39;m here not representing any  body in particular except my wife and my family. We are 6-year residents of Idaho, prior to that we have lived in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, Los Angeles, and other places. Understandably we are Idahoans by choice, and I&#39;m a Lutheran minister by voca tion. I suppose I could be bold to speak on behalf of the Creator of the areas that are under designation. Others have felt bold to do so, and I think I might do that. I do not fish, I do not hunt, I backpack very little; I have many members who do, many of them, seeming ly, on Sunday morning. I do not resent that. If they are out there working on their doctrine of creation, we can take care of the rest of it in other ways and at other times. And it&#39;s because we don&#39;t use those areas particularly in the same way that a lot of the people here do that I still propose to speak on behalf of the expan sion of the wilderness areas in the State of Idaho. I don&#39;t think that using them has to be a part of appreciating them. I&#39;m interest ed vitally in stewardship as a whole lifestyle, as a way of living not only in individuals, but of the whole Nation. As stewards of re sources of God, one of things we have to be very careful of is not to make short-range decisions. I think as a religious people but also as a people of this Nation and as a political people, it&#39;s vital that we think in terms of centur ies. It would be very easy to think in terms of short-term gains and not find good solutions for clear problems. Being stewards means, among other things, that things do not have to be used in order to be valuable. If they simply are, if they simply can be, and be al lowed to be as they were, that, I think, is in itself valuable. Our family travels a great deal and any number of times I will point out to my family either a given mountain or rocks or boul ders and say, kids, in most other places we have lived they would make that a State park. Idaho has those in abundance, but they are not the less valuable because they are abundant, but, I think, the more valuable. So, again, I urge you to think in terms of centuries to save the heritage that we have, to find other ways and, I think, even better ways to meet the pressing financial needs and to treasure the re sources that by God's grace Idaho has.

Thank you, Senator. I wish to apologize for being late. I was here earlier and I misjudged the amount of time this was going to last today. I&#39;d like to take just a moment to express my views on wilderness in the southern Lemhis and talk about Tyler Peak, specifically. I have a special feeling of affection for this peak because it shares my last name. And I&#39;ve&#39; taken the liberty of bringing a picture of what it looks like because I figured that prob ably few people here are familiar with it or have ever seen it. I think that is typical of area in the Lemhis between Saddle and Dia mond Peaks, and has some special qualities about it which are comparable to any of the wilderness areas in the State that have already been designated. The area used to be a bighorn sheep range, and when I was up there last summer I found an old horn from a bighorn sheep. And last fall, I think, the Idaho Fish and Game people introduced 18 bighorn sheep to try to reestablish a herd up there. And I think that it would really be great if that herd takes and establishes a viable population and can be hunted and provide a source of recre ation for some of the people here. There&#39;s also a herd of over 100 mountain goats, cougars, bears, and I&#39;ve seen elk there above the timberline, too. Basically, I think it&#39;s a beautiful area that deserves inclusion, in my opinion, in your wilderness bill. Thank you. (The prepared statement of Mr. Tyler follows:] Statement of Robert Tyler, Idaho Falls, Idaho I would like to talk about Tyler Peak which is in the southern Lemhi Mountains. This area is also in the Diamond Peak Roadless Area and is part of the Challis and  Targhee National Forests. Last year I hiked up Tyler Peak and found an old horn from a bighorn sheep ram. The southern Lemhis used to be bighorn sheep range and the Idaho Fish and Game Department reintroduced 18 bighorn sheep to the area last fall. Hopefully, this mag nificent and shy animal will expand its numbers sufficiently enough to become a turntable population in the future. The southern Lemhi&#39;s also contain a herd of over 100 mountain goats. I have seen elk browsing above timberline and I am told that bear and mountain lions are also present. Due to its rugged beauty and big game animal population, I think it would be very appropriate to classify the southern Lemhis as wilderness.",Thank you.

I&#39;m retired and a private citizen; I&#39;m here as a private citizen. First, let me express my ap    771  preciation for the opportunity to participate in these hearings. Briefly and specifically stated, Senator McClure and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee are urged to, No. 1, in clude in any legislation the endangered Idaho wilderness core. No. 2, not include any hard release language in the wilderness bill that will prevent the later review of nondesignated wilderness land for protection as wilderness. Assure that at least 50 percent of Idaho&#39;s present 6.5 million acres of national forest roadless land be protect ed by wilderness designation in your legislation. Under normal conditions, I would probably not be at these hear ings. However, normal conditions do not presently prevail. While a strong supporter of the present administration and the Idaho con gressional delegation 2 years ago, I presently find myself disillu sioned and, as others, particularly the ladies, question the credibil ity of the present administration. While the ladies have their prob lem area, mine is the present questionable handling of the Nation&#39;s natural resources. The sale of this country&#39;s natural resources are irreversible; unlike timber contracts, these sales cannot be renego tiated. What is lost to the private sector is lost forever. Mr. Watt&#39;s statement that we cannot afford to lock up valuable timber and mining resources recalls as a youth my experience in visiting a large mining company&#39;s claims on Federal lands to drop sticks of dynamite in holes to move 500 cubic feet of dirt annually to keep the claim valid. No other mining work was ever done, and these claims are still valid to this day, 40 years later, to the best of my knowledge. This is locking up valuable mining resources for the mining companies. Approximately 6 years ago during the fuel shortage, my relatives in Evanston, Wyo., laughed and showed me capped natural gas and oil wells on Federal land because the oil companies said there was no pipeline. This, in effect, is locking up valuable oil resources for the petroleum companies. However, if natural gas and oil prices greatly increased, we would have the fastest pipelines in history. Moral: Congress should reform archaic mining laws and require actual production in 3 years from companies holding Federal claims and oil rights. Thank you very much.","Thank you, Mr. Blaes.

Thank you, Senator. My name is Jeffrey Cook. I&#39;m an  avid outdoor recreationist. I love the Idaho back country, and I cross-country ski all winter. I&#39;ve climbed many of the peaks men tioned, I&#39;ve run the rivers on the rafts, and I like to ride trail mo torcycles to help explore our back country. I support the multipleuse concept of land management and I will explain the basis for this position and provide some testimony on specific areas support ing this multiple use. I&#39;m an active member of the Idaho Trail Ma chines Association, about 500 members statewide, and one of the 25,000 off-road motorcyclists in Idaho. Last year our association    776  helped clear and maintain 584 miles of trails in national forests. We assisted the Forest Service in obtaining funds from the State off-road vehicle fund to improve trail design, eliminate erosion, re route trails, and this benefits all users, hikers, horsemen, trail bikers, alike. I&#39;m also a member of the Idaho Trails Council, a group that is working to improve the cooperation and understanding between all types of trail users. A few years back I got a Keep Idaho Green Award from our Governor because, using my trail bike, my sons and I discovered a fire burning back in the back country. We were able to quickly get out and get some help before it spread into a dangerous situation. So my contention is that trail bikes can be a benefit to the envi ronment. And through multiple use management, Forest Service has improved the wilderness, characteristics can be preserved, all these areas provide wonderful back-country opportunities. The wil derness designation really restricts management options. You could have fire damage due to not being able to get fire crews in, decayed timber would not be harvested, less trail maintenance, you would lose the volunteer work that our organization does. Also, nonmotorist trails are unavailable in multiple-use areas in our national forests through their ORV travel plan. In the Forest Service publication called &#39;Leave No Trace,&#39; where they&#39;re teach ing wilderness skills, they&#39;re suggesting that lots of exciting backcountry areas that offer more solitude than some highly publicized wildernesses can actually increase the pressure on it. In the Big Holes, we definitely support no wilderness. A multi ple-use option for that, there have been ORV fundings spent in that area to improve the Black Canyon Trail to get it out of the gulley and up on the side hill where it won&#39;t erode. And there&#39;s no conflict for the present multiple use. I&#39;ve skied across the country for 3 days and it was a welcome sign to see some snow machine tracks so I could get a little glide going on the way out. And, also, in cross-country skiing, some of the clearcut slopes offer some of the best downhills for cross-country skiers. So in the Lemhis, again, extensive areas are available for nonmotorized use. I&#39;ve experienced true solitude climbing Saddle and Bell Mountains. I&#39;ve used my trail bikes to get up to the base of those, and I think the multiple-use concept will still provide all with their choice of recreation in these areas. I would like to make a comment to the White Clouds, that many of the trails in the White Clouds are now closed to motorized use.

I am a float and power boat operator outfitter  on the Salmon, Snake, and Clearwater Rivers.  I would just like to summarize my testimony. I wish to support  for inclusion in your bill four roadless areas and one river. They  are: Big Canyon, which is RARE II No. 01853, part of the Hell&#39;s  Canyon National Recreation Area at 16,500 acres; Klompton Creek,  Corral Creek, RARE II No. 01854â€”1 hope that&#39;s not me. Part of the Hell&#39;s Canyon NRA bordered by the  classified wild river section of the Snake at 24,300 acres. I feel very  strongly about the last three items that I am going to ask because I  hear so much input that this may be the last time around for wil-  derness in Idaho. Two of them are BLM inventory areas. The con-  fluence area of the Salmon-Snake, BLM, inventory No. 62-2, locat-  ed along the lower Salmon River at the confluence with 5, 110  acres, and Snow Hole Canyon, BLM, inventory No. 62-1, located  along the lower Salmon, also with 5,068 acres. And I would also  like to ask that you consider classification of the lower 53 miles of  the Salmon River in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act as a scenic     river in your bill.  These are requests for important reasons. But the most impor-  tant one I feel is the economic benefits to the Lewiston area.  People come here to raft on our rivers and to enjoy this experience.  I have some data that I included from the State of Idaho Depart-  ment of Economic and Community Affairs that tourism ranks as  the No. 3 industry in Idaho behind only agriculture and manufac-  turing and in front of timber.  All of these areas have gone through the final U.S. Forest Serv-  ice and BLM planning process and stand ready for classification.  As you know, the Salmon River was recommended to Congress for  exactly the classification I asked for in September of 1973 after a  full public planning process and completion of the environmental  impact statement.  And I would appreciate your consideration of these ideas, and, as  always, I enjoy the opportunity of sitting across the table testifying  before you.

One is my own personal experience in Long Canyon. About 3 years ago I and a group of four or  five other guys made the mistake of hiking the entire canyon in 1  dayâ€”about 20 miles. We made it out, but I remember that just as  if it was yesterday. It was just a unique experience. The Rain  Forest aspect of itâ€”the canyon is so unique compared to the  Alpineâ€”the Selkirk Crest, which is somewhat barren. It&#39;s pretty in  its own respects, but it&#39;s barren compared to the lustiness, the     mushrooms, and the greenery of the canyon. Even though we went  in September and it was a dry summer, it was still green.  I recently returned from Mount Rainier State Parkâ€”National  Park over there. And I was hiking around in the woods there. I  just kind of remembered Long Canyon. There were so much similarity. And I think it&#39;s so unique that it&#39;s worth preservation.  The second point I wanted to make was the economics. I think  backpackers and campers probably spend more money in a small  community. We hit the rain in Mount Rainier. And you can enjoy  the rain so much. But you have to get out, warm up, go in and  have a cold drink and a warm hamburger. And I think people that  go to Long Canyonâ€”even though they re only from Coeur d'Alene  or Kootenai County, I think they&#39;re going to spend some time and  spend some money in Bonners Ferry up there.

Yes. Senator McClure and Senator Symms, glad  you could make it here, I want to thank you for this time to express my views on the roadless areas. My name is Mardell Edwards, and I reside at Rt. 2, Grangeville, Idaho. I have lived in  Idaho County all my life except for 2 years when my husband was  in the service.  I would like to paint a picture of Idaho for you, even more specifically, Idaho County. I have some maps and fact sheets to illustrate  my concerns. I have been involved in this wilderness issue in Idaho  from the beginning.  As you all know Idaho has approximately 53 million acres, of  which 33% million acres is federally owned. If you&#39;ll look at the  map, the yellow and the pinkish down there is BLM land, which is  federally owned. He tacked a map up there. And only parts of the  white portions of that map is privately owned property. So that  gives us a little better picture of our State than just the forest  lands. And 2% million acres is State lands, leaving only 16% million acres of privately owned land with a population of 943,935.  697  Idaho County is the largest county in Idaho with 5,464,960 acres  of which 96,000 acres are BLM land, and 4,432,982 acres of U.S.  Forest lands, with all of the Nez Perce and parts of four other national forests within its boundaries, of which approximately 1.7  million acres is classified as Wilderness. This only leaves 935,978  acres of privately owned land in our county to support a population  of 14,769. Yes, you heard right, we have more wilderness acres  than private owned acres.  The PILT money, or the payment in lieu of taxes, we receive is  formulated according to acres, or not to exceed a set amount according to the population; which we received $434,000 in 1980. The  forest funds or 25 percent of timber sales was decreased from  $4,143,308.12 in 1979, to $1,061,224.98 in 1983 for our county. This  drastically affects our revenues for county roads and schools. The  timber industry has been very badly depressed and this affects all  other economy in our area.  Is it no wonder that Idaho has high unemployment, poor economy, and problems of funding the schools and local and state governments. When you look at this map, practically all areas of the  State are affected by public land issues.",,MARDELL EDWARDS,"GRANGEVILLE, IDAHO",Edwards,Mardell,h2d2,"edwards, mardell",Grangeville (CITY); Idaho County (COUNTY); U.S. (COUNTRY); Wilderness (WILDERNESS),text

Thank you, Senator. My testimony would be split into two segments. First I would like to comment on behalf of the Shoshone Bannock Indian Tribes, as you know I served as their legal counsel, and I would like to make some comment in my ca pacity as a State representative. To begin with, on behalf of the Shoshone Bannock Indian Tribe, I represent approximately 3,100 citizens in Idaho, and their concern has to do with their off-reservation treaty rights which may be af fected by the designation of wilderness areas within the State. Pre viously they laid claim to approximately 20 million acres of land, a vast majority of those lands being located within what is now the State of Idaho pursuant to the 1868 Fort Bridger Treaty. The Indi ans relinquished the claim to those lands in exchange for the prom ise of the United States to protect them on the reservation that would be the size of approximately 1.8 million acres. As a part of that bargain, the United States recognized the right of the Indian people on Fort Hall Indian Reservation to go off reservation to ex ercise rights, pursuant to the treaty, to hunt and fish on unoccu pied land of the United States. The Indian people have also been recognized as having rights to timber access, to timber, and to get food gathering for subsistence needs; they are also concerned be cause many of the areas now under consideration have a religious significance to them. They, I believe, would just as soon as see all of the lands now under consideration be protected to the fullest extent possible, being designated as wilderness; although, at the same time realiz ing that that is in reality not going to come about, they would like the Idaho delegation to consider their rights that are protected pur suant to Federal law under the treaty. And one of the observations that they would like to make is that in the previous legislative action that has been taken with regard to public lands, very little, if any, consideration is ever given to the protection in the continu ation of those treaty rights, and they would like to offer to the Sen ator&#39;s staff and the services of their legal counsel and staff people to coordinate to make sure that their rights are protected. Many times, I think, their main concern is on the sale of public lands, any disposition of the public lands, their treaty rights do not neces sarily carry forward. Although that is not what we&#39;re talking about here, we would like the opportunity to sit down with the staff of the Senator and take a look at whatever legislation is proposed to see that there is maybe some protective language built in there so  573     that the Indian tribes do not further have their treaty rights di minished. I just would like to mention very briefly that the main areas that they are concerned about would be the White Clouds area, the Lost River range, and the Lemhi range, for the reason that those areas are areas that are very important for their salmon fishing re source. In previous years the tribes had abundant fishing opportu nity for the anadromous fish; in the last 5 or 6 years their rights to salmon fishing have been severely restricted. Also in the eastern part of the State, the Garns Mountain, Palisades, and Bear Creek areas are particularly of concern to them because of the big game and wildlife considerations. In my capacity as a State representative I would simply like to mention that I feel that the people in my legislative districts are very much concerned about public lands issues. Most of their con cern has been with regard to the asset management program, the possible sale of Federal lands. And I know that this hearing is not meant to address that particular issue, I appreciate the Senator&#39;s availability of the meeting tomorrow and I understand will address that subject, but on the wilderness designation, what I&#39;m concerned about is the people in my district. I don&#39;t know if they really un derstand the various classifications that are being talked about, so I&#39;ll speak in very general terms. I think that what they want to see is the basic character of the lands remain as they are now; whether that comes through a wilderness designation or not, I don&#39;t think they want to see a great deal of development take place in those forest lands without some pressing economic need. I know that many of the areas that are under consideration right now are actu ally, as far as timber sales go, maybe subsidized by the Govern ment. If the lands are to be developed, I believe that they should be developed on their own merit for economic reasons. And I think that one of the other considerations that we, as citi zens of Idaho, all have is that we have a State that has a lot of these wilderness areas. I think they ought to be protected; I think it&#39;s important to the tourism industry. And I would urge the Sena tor to give very careful consideration, be very cautious. Although we say that it&#39;s been under study for 20 years, I would hope that we will not make any snap decisions. And in some of the areas that may be questionable, I would like to see a cautious approach taken. I think it&#39;s better that we be â€” if we&#39;re going to error in any way, to do that on the safe side in protecting those lands for further consid eration at a later time.

Mr. McClure and staff, I am Daniel Baldwin from  Elk City. Ive been a resident of Idaho County all my life, which is  39 years. I am married and have one 10-year old child. We have  built our own log home in the Elk City area. My wife and I are  both employed at Shearer Lumber Products. We feel we are very  fortunate to live in the area and have steady employment with suf   ficient income to make ends meet. But the future in Idaho County  will not be bright unless we can settle these land issues. Our  timber industry, county planners, and school systems have based  their future plans upon the availability of a major portion of the  roadless areas for timber harvest.  On the Nez Perce Forest we cannot afford to have any more of  these lands locked up. Please work toward the resolution of the following points: No. 1, the release of all RARE I lands released to  multiple use development by individual unit plans; No. 2, the immediate release to multiple use of all those RARE II lands released  to multiple use development by committee language attached to  the Central Idaho Wilderness Act, mainly Jersey Jack, Mallard  Creek, Bargamin Creek, Running Creek, East and West Meadow  Creek, the immediate release of those lands covered in the Gospel  Hump Multiple Resource Development Area plans, no changes or  multipleâ€”excuse meâ€”no changes or modifications to the present  boundaries, no deferred or further study status to any of the lands  in question.  Having been raised on a small farm with a large family, I think I  know what it takes to grow something like a vegetable or a tree.  Having traveled extensively in our roaded and roadless areas, I  know that there is a lot of good soil out there. I know that the  logâ€”that logging will be done under very strict guidelines. If there  is aâ€”if that tree out there is not of quality at this time, we can  grow a better one next time. Looking back some 30 years, I will say  our streams are as clean as they were 30 years ago. Logging and  game management are very compatible. Our Idaho Fish and Game  Department has let 500â€”500 elk permits in hunting Unit 14 and  537  200 cow permits in Unit 16 this year in 1983. These are two extensive roaded areas. And I have submitted a map with outlines to  that effect. The fish and game have not allowed the harvest of one  cow elk in any of our back country or wilderness areas for several  years.

Together with my husband, I operate a small business  enterprise providing jobs for nine people in a small community located in a large forest; the Nez Perce National Forest. As a small  business person, I was part of an endangered speciesâ€”until  Reaganomics took hold. Thank goodness our Government is finally  beginning to show some signs of reasonableness and commonsense.  We must now have the courage to apply these same traits to the  management of our national resources.  The Nez Perce Forest has almost one-half million acres of designated roadless areas. These lands were thoroughly investigated and  discussed in 1979, prior to passage of the River of No Return Wilderness bill. It was no mistake then that these lands were left out  of the wilderness classification and it would be no mistake now to  statutorily declare these as multiple use lands dedicated to man639  agement for the most beneficial uses of society. The Elk City economy is based on mining, timber harvest, fishing, hunting, and recreational pursuits of all forms. Proper management considers and optimizes all these factors. The wilderness designation is a &#39;no management&#39; designation and, as such, we have no further need for  that category in our area.

Mr. Chairman, I am Dianne Waldemarason,  wife and working mother.  Today you heard from many special interest groups. I also have a  special interest, my children. I want my children to be healthy, to  hie well educated, and to be able to explore and respect their environment. I want my children and grandchildren to have a quality  life.  A qaulity life depends upon a steady, reliable income. My job is  indirectly paid by revenue from the timber industry. My husband's  income is directly dependent upon logging in the Nez Perce National Forest. Logging in the Nez Perce is dependent upon continued  availability of harvestable timber.  I believe everyone must evaluate their life and set priorities. For  some, the wilderness experience is important. For others, job security is more important.  One priority I have for my children is an excellent education.  Currently, Idaho is ranked among the States with the lowest spending for education per student. How can public school educate  Idaho&#39;s future leaders without adequate funds? The key to the  future is in properly educating our children today. Money or education comes from working men and women.  I also want my children to have the opportunity to enjoy the na   tional forest which is our backyard. My children can learn to respect the forest and get closer to nature if vehicular access is provided. They can learn to appreciate God's handiwork without the  need for special use permits and extended backpacking trips.  Idaho has contributed 3.8 million acres to the National Wilderness System. I believe it is time to stabilize the forest employment  base in Idaho. Loggers, millworkers, truck drivers, teachers, mechanics, car salesmen, and many others are directly or indirectly  dependent upon paychecks derived from the timber industry.  Mr. Chairman, I support final resolution of the wilderness issue.  I want to see the wilderness question finalized on the Nez Perce  Forest. I believe that all of the RARE I and RARE II lands which  were not specifically set aside as wilderness should be released for  multiple-use management. There should be no compromise of the  present boundaries, and further wilderness studies are unnecessary. The specific areas I would like to see released are Jersey  Jack, Mallard Creek, Bargamin Creek, Running Creek, and east  and west Meadow Creek.  Nineteen years of study, restudy, legal action, and legislative  hearings have cost taxpayers a lot of money and yielded no final  answer. Recreation is an important industry nationwide. However,  Idaho and the Nation, both need a viable timber industry, not  locked up forests and unemployment. I urge you to support the  timber industry and draft a bill that will assure jobs for my family  and thousands of other families. My children, and all children, deserve a quality life.

Mr. Waldermarson, there was a witness earlier today who was

concerned about the conditions on the Jersey Jack. Concerned

about the road that was being built. But he made comments about

the character of the timber in that area. Could you tell me what

the timber resource is in the Jersey Jack?

Mr. Waldemarson. We&#39;ll find that on a lot of the ridge tops out

there, you will find small stands of lodgepole pine. These are, in all

sense of the word, probably in a marginal condition. As you move

downhill into the draws or drainages, you find increasing caliber-

sized trees and increasing volume per acre. And as he says, you

start picking up your spruce, your fir, and your Doug fir. Your pon-

dersosa pine are further down and onto the Salmon River breaks.

We feel that there is enough volume out there and the economics

are such that with that road in place, we could operate feasibly out

there.

The Chairman. That&#39;s farther down over the side.

Mr. Waldemarson. In that whole area, yes.

The Chairman. What&#39;s the age and the quality of the lodgepole?

Mr. Waldemarson. It is quite variable. It&#39;s running, if I recall

the figures from the Forest Service anywhere from 60 to 120 years.

The Chairman. Well, you&#39;ve indicated in your testimony that

there&#39;s about 10 Vz million board-feet per year potential yield?




Mr. Waldemarson. Correct.

The Chairman. Is that on a sustained-yield basis or is that

simply a once-time through?

Mr. Waldemarson. That would be over the next fiscal 4-year

planning period in 1982â€”1984, excuse me, through 1987.

The Chairman. Do you know what the sustained yield for that

areas would be?

figures around.

I was told that experts were especially welcomed here. I am not an expert, except in human values. I am distressed to learn that we are expected now to make a decision for all time about our wil derness. I am getting the feeling that perhaps we are being stam  553  peded by the economic problems that we are facing in Idaho and parts of the Nation, and I would like to recommend that we not make final decision this early in the game about how much wilder ness forever. I am here talking about these issues, because we retired here from Mountain Home Air Force Base. We chose this area, because we were introduced to the Trinities. I would like to speak especial ly about them. They are so accessible to this large population  center. We were impressed by the number of folks retired from the air base, and came to reunions at the air base in a couple of years after we did. There were some 250 folks who value the wild parts of Idaho, and they are contributing members to the community. They were folks who were teaching school, who were opening small busi nesses, and employed six to a dozen new employees. They were re claiming desert land, and raising potatoes. We really feel that the value to all folks cannot be underestimat     ed.  I would like to close by saying that much has been made of the fact that perhaps wilderness is left for the rich, and I would say that the handicapped, us grayhairs, and the poor really can access the wilderness. Backpacking is one of the least expensive sports that one can engage in. Some of us grayhairs are living longer and being healthier, and I think we, too, can appreciate these wild parts of Idaho. I would hope that we would delay the decision, and I would also hope that we go for the maximum amount of wilderness that is compatible with the economic uses we have to consider.

Senator McClure, I&#39;d like to note that there is some letters here from the Clark County people that are against the wil  derness that I brought down and submit here today. And, also, that wilderness, who will benefit if the national forest are made accessi ble only by horse or foot? Only a very small percent can enjoy the national forest. The people that have the time to enjoy are the eld erly, and surely they can&#39;t do it by walking or on horseback. About the only ones that will enjoy the national forest will be the forest service personnel and what few backpackers there are. The forest service land plays a very important role in our lives, more than recreation. All the people of the United States depends on what minerals, forestry, and grazing lands there are in this na tional forest. I am sure that the people of this land would not like to go with out the wood to make their homes or their cars, planes, or phones, which all come from the minerals of the forest lands. Nor would they like to go without meat which the cattle provide, and they are raised on these grazing lands. Who is it that really wants to put everything into wilderness? You always hear the environmentalists and Sierra Club saying more wilderness, but has anyone really looked into who is pushing for more wilderness? The wilderness studies are under a lot of different headings, like the Targhee Proposed Land Management Plan or RARE I, II, and IE, then they become the biosphere reserve studies. There are 27 biosphere reserve studies going on in the United States today. I got very curious one day about the biosphere reserve and who was behind it, so I went to my local library and did some research. I found that there was even another organization behind the bio sphere reserve called UNESCO, which stands for the U.N. Educa tional, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. I asked myself, who is UNESCO? I did some more looking and found that it is run by socialist countries. I do not believe that these countries â€” I do not believe that these countries should be al lowed to tell us how to run our country, or be in any part of the wilderness study in any way. I do not believe that the wilderness plan is beneficial to anyone in any way. It does more damage than good.  Now, the UNESCO organization, I found this information right out of our library. Anybody is accessible to it if they go and do a study on biosphere and who is backing it. This UNESCO is an orga nization that is funding the study of the wilderness. They make a decision of what should go in the wilderness, what shouldn&#39;t. And I  32-426  0-84  4Â»  770  found â€” have not found yet anything that they have turned down.

I&#39;m Leona Blair from Cottonwood, a citizen of Idaho  County and a former county commissioner. So I&#39;ve learned firsthand what the loss of timber sales can do for our schools and     county roads. But, today I&#39;m mostly testifying for Idaho County  Farm Bureau which I&#39;m secretary of.  The Idaho County Farm Bureau strongly favors multiple use of  public lands and no increase in wilderness acres.  Many of us know from experience that managed forest lands is  better for growing timber, pasture, and larger numbers of deer and  elk.  I think it is terribly wasteful to let forest fires burn out of control in the wilderness area, especially when so many people are  gathering firewood to relieve the energy shortage.  We appreciate Senator McClure&#39;s efforts in trying to bring about  a final solution in the near future so that the lands under study  can be released for multiple use.  Thank you, Senator McClure, for letting me testify today.","Thank you.

Very well pronounced. Thank you. Many people  have a lot of trouble with that. Senator McClure, I&#39;m a resident of Priest Lake.  Many highly qualified individuals before me have testified with  sound reasons for the urgency of protecting our wildlife. They have  spoken well and with wisdom. And I concur with them and support  their recommendations that we should retain all of the currently  wilderness designated areas in Idaho; and, in particular, to add to  it the Salmo-Priest and Long Canyon Selkirk-Crest.  Beyond that, there are certain philosophical issues and historical  facts that I believe cannot be overlooked. And I urge that they be  seriously considered in your deliberations.  By the force of creation, the complexity of life on Earth has  taken 3Vz billion years to develop and coexist in a unique state in  order which is essential to its fruitful continuation. Yet man per-  ceives some strange right to create conditions of disorder for his  304  own selfish interests. It would appear, therefore, that something is  seriously wrong with our ethos.  From having the experience of residing and living and traveling  over most of the globe for more than 30 years, I am deeply troubled  by witnessing in our country many of the ethics and practices that  have resulted in the permanent despoilation of large geographical  areas that were at one time as life supporting as ours was original-  iy.  In our own country, more land has been covered by roads than  the area of the original 13 colonies and that we are losing top soil  at the cumulative rate of 45 square miles per day. These are only  two of the many appalling consequences of our actions including  the non-ending extinction of our wildlife, both flora and fauna.  You and I are proud of a wonderful State which is blessed by  more wilderness than any other State except Alaska.","Thank you, Mr. Gindraux. The balance of your

My name is Steve McCrea, city councilman  for the city of Coeur d'Alene, I am an attorney. From my point of  view and the point of view of the constituency who I represent, the  primary issue today should not be a final determination of how  much wilderness there should be in Idaho. The issue should be how  much of the land can we preserve for future generations.  As a city official, the decisions which I make are not always popular, but my decisions are made from the perspective of a trustee  protecting the limited resources of the city for the citizens of the  municipal corporation. We have to work with a fixed budget, even  though the National Government does not. But there are only a  finite amount of natural resources on this planet, in the Nation,  and particularly in northern Idaho. The decisions that are made  now should not be made which will reduce those last few remaining roadless areas if there is no overriding need.  It&#39;s a fact that the city of Coeur d'Alene thrives on logging. Sev   eral hundred people in the town are employed at the mills, and we  have several hundred, if not several thousands, of independent loggers. Neither I nor the city council advocates doing away with the  logging industry, nor anything of the sort. Everyone likes to go out  in the woods and hunt and fish. Sharing the woods with a logging  truck is not a problem, but I think that the majority of the people  insist on some wilderness. The critical issue as to the decision of  exactly how much is not one that should be made at the present  time. The decision that is being made today could affect my children and grandchildren. The decisions should not be made now,  but when the need arises.  The roadless land we have now is like money in the bank, except  for the fact it can never be renewed. Once the road is built, the  character of the land changes forever.  As a legislator, I would ask you to please take a lesson from the  cities and conserve as much as you can until the need arises.

Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Senator McClure, and  staff members.  My name is Donna Favor. I live at 1036 North 23d Street in  Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  I am glad that the roadless areas are to be resolved, but I want  you to know that I believe that the U.S. Forest Service has done a  sufficient job in studying those lands, and that all roadless areas  should be released to nonwilderness uses.  I have lived all my life in the State of Idaho and the neighboring  State of Washington; the past 32 years in Idaho. There was a time I  lived in Victorville, Calif., in the middle of the Mojave desert for 6  months while my husband was mustering out of the U.S. Air Force  after a term in Korea. We missed our native pine trees so much we  would travel about 100 miles away to the Big Bear Lake area just  to see some pine trees.  I enjoy the scenic beauty of our forests, but they have an even  greater hold on me and my family; we are dependent on forest  timber for our home, food, clothing, everything it takes for a family  27  to live. We have an investment in the forests for tomorrow as well  as today. We have to take care of them that we may survive.  &#39;Taking care&#39; to me means managing the forests in an efficient  productive manner much as we do a vegetable garden. When I see  trees dead and dying unnecessarily from disease, fire, and insect infestation, I am sick inside for the waste I see. I think of homes for  families that could have been built and never will be because of the  waste. I think of job opportunities lost because of that needless  waste, too. And I think of moneys that could have gone to our  public schools, institutions, and roads through timber sales and are  lost in the wasted trees.  Senator McClure, I am at a loss to understand how the people of  Idaho are to live and take care of themselves and their families  without a stable industry.",,DONNA FAVOR,"WOMEN IN TIMBER, COEUR, d'ALENE, IDAHO",Favor,Donna,h2d1,"favor, donna",Coeur d'Alene (CITY); Idaho (STATE); Washington (STATE); Victorville (CITY); California (STATE); Mojave Desert (LANDFORM); Korea (COUNTRY); Bear Lake (LAKE),text

Senator, my name is Reuben Ellis. I&#39;m a farmer from  Boundary County.  I&#39;d like to discuss the value of the old-growth forest of Long  Canyon. Old growth is sometimes regarded as nearly timber that is  decreasing in value, a waste, and overmature. Well, the term  &#39;overmature&#39; applied to the forest in Long Canyon doesn&#39;t take  into account the many values of old growth. Old growth provides  very specific wildlife habitat, and stable, pur watershed. But allows  for a unique and increasingly popular recreational experience.  Even a fallen log in Long Canyon isn&#39;t truly wasted. Falling logs  are vital in nurturing timber and replenishing the nutrients applied to the soil.  Of course, the Forest Service considers old growth important, too.  They have a mandate, I believe, to keep 10 percent of their lands in  old growth. In fact, since the Forest Service hasn&#39;t finished survey   ing the Bonners Ferry Ranger District for old growth, it&#39;s an open  question whether they can stick to that 10 percent quota if Long  The Forest Service defines old growth as trees of 160 years old  and older, but looking at Long Canyon as just a bunch of 160-yearold trees, doesn&#39;t begin to touch the real significance of the place.  In calling the forest of Long Canyon overmature, well, it&#39;s iust like  saying that the acropolis would be an OK place if it weren t so old.  There may always be trees coming up the second growth at the  160-year mark, but if Long Canyon goes multiple use we risk an  original and untouched area that can^ be replaced. So, we need another term that goes beyond old-growth to describe Long Canyon. I  suggest the term &#39;wilderness.&#39;  I urge you to recommend wilderness status for Long Canyon and  the crest.

Good morning. My name is David Williamson.  I&#39;d like to begin by stating I support the inclusion of Long Canyon  and Mallard Larkins in the Idaho wilderness system.  There is great concern by myself and others that in your haste to  prepare your proposed wilderness legislation the technical information necessary for responsible decisionmaking is readily available  only from sources that are generally opposed to wilderness.  The Panhandle National Forest has in the past been poorly managed by the admission of the Forest Service itself. High quality accessible stands have been overharvested, leaving the poor quality  and/or inaccessible timber to bear the brunt of future timber harvest targets.  In support of its wilderness bill proposal, the Idaho Forest Indus   try Council does not accurately represent the conditions as they  exist in the Idaho Panhandle National Forests, maintaining that  the majority of roadless areas are average acres, similar to the  thousands of acres of national forest lands previously roaded and  developed, and that the reason that these lands have not been developed is by default and not through conscious management decisions.  This is simply not true. Steep slopes representing high road  costs, and low timber values have kept the roadless areas in the  panhandle as they are. The Forest Service has overcut the available and accessible lands in terms of other resource values. These  resources include fish, game, hydrologic and recreational resources.  These are not average acres. The roadless areas are, in a sense, the  remaining oasis for these resources.  In February of 1980 the Forest Service completed a timber harvest program analysis and evaluation which analyzed the timber  harvest program in relation to other resource values. The conclusion drawn by the staff differ measurably from information presented by the Forest Service Industry Council.  The merits of an accelerated capital construction access program  for preharvest roading is the subject of a 1981 Forest Service study.  The conclusion of the study is that such a program is necessary if  high risk, low-value stands are to remain in the timber base in  order to be consistent with multiple use sustained yield management. An analysis of the four top priority projects of the study  reveal that the projects are all close to deficit sale conditions,  meaning that the Government would be directly subsidizing the  timber industry to remove timber from these areas.",,DAVID WILLIAMSON,"COEUR d'ALENE, IDAHO",Williamson,David,h2d1,"williamson, david",Long Canyon (LANDFORM); Mallard-Larkins (WILDERNESS); Panhandle National Forest (FOREST); Idaho Panhandle National Forests (FOREST),text

I have stood by watching, remaining uninvolved  and hoping that someone else would do the work to stop the development of some of our most beautiful wilderness areas. Well, someone did save the River of No Return Wilderness in Salmon for me,  but I am here today to let you know that there are more people  like me who want to keep the bulldozers and helicopters out of  Long Canyon and other significant areas of wilderness.  Long Canyon should be protected from mining and logging, not  just because of its beauty, but because of its geological and environmental value. It should not just be classified as a roadless area, but  protected forever. The ancient cedars, are some of the last of their  size in this State. The cedars and the pines are so thick that the  forest industry merely wants to thin them out a little, although  that very denseness creates a dark forest canopy where the grizzly  bears, elk, deer, trout and mushrooms all abound because they are  safe from the easy grasp of man. You yourself said in your last     visit here that your favorite fishing stream was fished out as soon  as a logging road was put in next to it because the road gave easy  access to everyone.  It should be obvious to you by the abundance of testimonies here  that Long Canyon is an area which the people want protected.

Senator McClure, my name is Art Manley. I live in  Coeur d'Alene.  The reasonâ€”the major reason for wilderness designation is to  protect very special areas whether for rare plant species, game  habitat, critical watersheds or even special scenic values. That designation and protection must be by Congress if it&#39;s going to be permanent, if it&#39;s going to be meaningful.  I think three areas in particular fit those qualifications in several respects, and I have hiked and backpacked in each of those  three. One, of course, is Salmo Priest, which I think hasâ€”on the  upper Priest River area has the only or the nearest to a rain forest  in the State of Idaho that I know of, and some very special and  quite rare plant species, and old-growth timber. Long Canyon, of  course, has been discussed at length already, and I won&#39;t go back  into that. The Mallard-Larkins area, I would particularly urge that  Snow Peak be included and added to that area along with enough  buffer area around in the lower country so that there are no roads  close to the major areas particularly that support the largest goat  herds in the State of Idaho. And those goats have been transplanted up to Pend Oreille, for instance, and ma: y other places, even     throughout the country.  I point out, also, that as far as the panhandle is concerned, and I  would have to include the greater Spokane area because that&#39;s  almost a part of us here in the use of our national forests, that we  don&#39;t have a designated wilderness area within at least 5 or 6  hours of travel. Some of these areas, if designated, could cut that  time in half, and there&#39;s a lot of pressure coming from these areas.  Finally, I would suggest intensive management of the lands both  public and private that we have not forestry would be the longrange solution.  Thank you.","Thank you.

I would like to speak in favor of as much  wilderness as possible, and also protecting as much land that is not  quite worthy of being called wilderness from exploitation until  such time as the lumber companies can be a little less hard on the  land they do harvest.  My principal reason is that I think that there&#39;s a tendency to  overestimate future demands. This is what got WHOOPS in trouble, that&#39;s what got Tosco and Exxon in trouble with shale; it has  got the lumber companies in trouble when they overbid a few years  ago on timber sales; and it&#39;s what got the paper industry currently  in awful trouble here.  In my business, we consume about 150 tons of newsprint a year.  What&#39;s going on is a glut in a price war.  169  The documents I have submitted include a couple of articles on  the effort of eastern millsâ€”papermills to raise their prices to $500  a ton; the ultimate result which was the western mills undercut  them in price, discounted, and the current price is 5 percent less  than it was at the beginning of the year, $445 a ton. And as far as  consumption goes, one of the sheets that I submitted shows what&#39;s  happened to the price of newsprint in the last 10 years. Namely, it  has gone up very steeply until this year. Meanwhile, utilization has  slowed in the early 1970&#39;s and leveled off flat in the 1980&#39;s. But let  me assure you that advertising is way up. It&#39;s more profitable than  ever. There&#39;s more advertising in newspapers than ever, and advertisers are very clever in their use. They&#39;re just like motorists who  get more miles per gallon. We now get more advertising per square  inch than would have been believed possible in the early 1970&#39;s.  And I believe the lessons of overâ€”of high prices, high postal rates,  repeated shortages have not been lost on the users, and we must  assume that the timber industry can be very far off in their estimate of what they need, at least for paper products.",,CAROL STACEY,"COEUR d'ALENE, IDAHO",Stacey,Carol,h2d1,"stacey, carol",,text

Prior to moving to  Idaho, I was employed by the Forest Service for many years in various positions, and in forest administration, and I feel that I have  an appreciation of the pressures exerted by various well-meaning  interested groups for management of our national forests.  I believe that watershed protection is the first priority of the national forest management. That and wilderness go hand in hand in  my opinion.  I endorse for wilderness the Salmo Priest, the Long Canyon, Selkirk Crest, and the Mallard Larkins, Scotchmans Peak, and the  grandmother mountain areas of the Panhandle National Forest,  along with boundaries recommended by the Idaho Conservation  League.     We have hiked, backpacked, and camped in most of these areas,  and feel that they are truly outstanding, worthy of preservation for  future generations. I support a viable forest products industry in  the Idaho panhandle, but I do not believe that these areas contain  enough commerical forest values to preclude them or supercede  their wilderness values. In my mind, it&#39;s a matter of the greatest  goods and the greatest number in the long run. Intensive forest  management on better growing growth sites will yield much greater timber production in the years ahead.  I hope that legislation under the Idaho Forest Management Act  will not readily preclude consideration of wilderness designation  for roadless areas in the future.  Than you.","Tom Vinion.

Senator McClure, I am truly grateful for this opportunity to have  my comments heard regarding the Idaho Forest Wilderness decisions.  I am in favor of protecting 50 percent of the presently remaining  forest and roadless areas.  The fact that Idaho how almost 4 million acres of wilderness, the  most in the 48 contiguous States, is something to be proud of. And  we would be prouder, still if some of the forest roadless areas in  northern Idaho were to be designated as wilderness, specifically  Long Canyon and Salmo Priest Areas.  Let us at this point say that we will try to preserve as much wilderness as possible for those generations that are not here to speak  for themselves, for the 21st century and on for whatever wilderness  exists now is the most that we will ever have.  I&#39;d like to add a comment or two from what I heard this morning. Years ago when I traveled out here, I saw many clear-cuts  years ago. Those same clear-cuts exist today. That&#39;s almost 20     years. And I learned since then that these clear-cuts do not enhance not only view but they contribute to rapid snow melt since  there&#39;s no cover. And the rapid show melt increases erosion. And  erosion, naturally, adds to stream pollution.  So in regards to these clear-cuts, I&#39;ve also learned that in the  Panhandle Forest that as the management plan suggests that 20  cubic feet per acre of timeber can be harvested per year. And I  question that whether this number can be achieve into perpetuity.  I doubt it very much. And it&#39;s only a matter of years that if the  timber industry goes ahead and harvests it, that it will only be a  matter of time that they will have to move out and on.

I would also like to relate a personal incident that occurred only  3 weeks ago when I was in Long Canyon with my family. But I  think the time limit would preclude that.  I wanted to hit the economic argument because that, I think, is a  very important argument in times like these. But before I do that,  as a teacher of environmental science, I would like to mention the     value of wilderness as an ecological laboratory. The base line, if  you will, for science can study the natural processes that maintain  life on Earth. By studying undisturbed ecosystems, we may learn  how to prevent and repair damage in ecosystems that we do develop.  Wilderness is also a gigantic reservoir of diverse streams and  animal and plant life. Many of which have never been studied for  their potential use.  For these reasons, it is desirable to establish wilderness areas in  diverse type of ecosystems. As you know, Senator, Idaho has no wilderness north of the Lochsa River. And this should be addressed in  this final wilderness bill.  Because of limitations of time, I am skipping over the economic  arguments because they take too long to develop in depth. But I  will state that it would be foolish, indeed, to base our wilderness  decisions only on the present net value of timber. But when such  values turn out to be negative without even considering the economic benefits of nontimber factors, then to recommend such areas  for development is financial dismanagement of the worst kind.  If I thought it would be administered fairly, I believe I would  support a bill that would simply forbid any depth of timber sales  on Federal land.",Thank you.

Senator McClure, I am concerned about any haste in  passing a new Idaho Wilderness Act. Is there not time to treat each  roadless area as a unique unit the established step-by-step process  of study and recommendation?  285  The concept of deciding now, once and for all and closing future  options, while tidy, does not convey the ring of wisdom.  To earn my spurs on this creative panel, I have resorted to didy  form. We may ask: What&#39;s the rush? Tell us what&#39;s happening.  Why the rush? What will the future bring?  The tall trees of Long Canyon have been standing far longer  than Congress has been sitting.  What&#39;s the rush? Why the hurry? Need we push in August  flurry?

Who can  be worried?  Heart Lake in the Mallard-Larkins has seen generations of deer  reflected in its waters. Have we not time for reflection, too?  The mills in the town in southern Oregon where I grew up have  long since closed down. The trees were cut and with them went the  jobs. Is the legislation that is proposed for Idaho going to benefit all  the people, land, and resources of Idaho, or just the companies that  may, in their fickle ways, abandon us as they did my home town  once the trees are gone?

Thank you for arranging this opportunity for citizens to speak today.  My name is Stephen A. Ruppel. I reside at 1110 St. Maries here  in Coeur d'Alene. I am speaking as a private citizen today for two  positions I would like to see included in a good wilderness bill. In  summary, these are: One, inclusion of areas designated wilderness  for North Idaho. Specifically the Salmo-Priest, Long Canyon, and  Mallard-Larkins areas. And two, no exclusion of areas designated  wilderness study in any legislation.  As fishermen and backpackers, my wife and I have hiked in the  Long Canyon drainage, the Salmo-Priest trails, and the St. Joe  Lake area of the proposed Mallard-Larkins areas. These areas are  important wildlife and fish habitat and watershed as well as recreational. They should be included in an expanded North Idaho and  Eastern Washington wilderness system. Wilderness areas will attract tourists and clean tourist dollars to our area. These tourists  will use the wilderness and contiguous State and national forest  campgrounds for extended stays to see one of the last large wilderness systems in the lower 48 States. As a taxpayer, I support legislation to support the growing tourist industry, the second largest  industry in our country. I do not support any legislation which  would tax subsidized roadbuilding in the areas with little sustainable timber potential.  Lack of timber potential should not be the criteria for what we  will allow to become wilderness, however, I enjoy hiking in dense,  old growth forest when I can. This is an opportunity which will diminish if all high quality timber producing areas are cut on an accelerated schedule. We in Idaho are the trustees for a great deal of  the remaining wilderness in the United States. We must protect  and expand wilderness protection in our Nation as a whole and  292  that means that high quality areas in North Idaho must expand.  We have some of the most beautiful areas left to do this. Leave 2 or  3 million more of this country as God made it.  There is nothing that says we have the current hold on wisdom  for all time. Therefore, let&#39;s not designate or not designate every  acre at this time. What is the hurry? Future generations may wish  to categorize land differently based on other technology, changing  human interests, or hopefully a greater regard for the right to coexist with us on this planet.  I also would like to mention that I would appreciate evening  hearings in the future. I find it difficult to break away from work  to come down.","I&#39;ve had that comment from others.

It is usually best to roll them into the canyon. The road is narrow. To swerve  might make more dead. By glow of the taillight, I stumble back of the car and stood  by the heat. A doe. A recent killing. She had stiffened already almost cold. I  dragged her off. She was large in the belly. My fingers touching her side brought me  to reason her side was warm. Her fawn lay there waiting alive, still, never to be  born.  Beside that mountain road, I hesitated. The car aimed ahead at lowered parking  lights under the hood purred the steady engine. I stood in the glare of the warm  exhaust turning red. Around our group, I could hear the wilderness listen.  I thought hard for all of us, my only swerving, and then pushed her over the edge  into the river.  The wilderness listens to you, Senator McClure. Think hard for  us all. Decide for us all. We all know the inevitable result of a  clash between a world of made and world of born. It is impossible  to air for too much wilderness. For like the fawn, future generations wait.

Timber and mining come and go. And I&#39;ve  seen hundreds and hundreds of towns and small cities in which the  lumber interests have moved out both on the east and on the west  coasts. Many people unemployed. Scabbed over landscapes. And  there&#39;s not much attention given to even repairing the damage  that&#39;s done. Move on to some other area. And this will occur in this  area, too.     I feel that the greatest and foremost economy for north Idaho  and the greatest opportunity that the people here have is in the  small, clean industries far exceeding the number of employees and  the type of lifestyle that the timber industry can never furnish.  The timber industry will leave in time. I&#39;m sure of that. It may be  only a matter of 10 years some will be pulling out.  I believe we should give a lot to the opportunities of this sort in  north Idaho.

Senator McClure, thank you for coming today. I&#39;ve  been an Idaho resident for 14 years and have enjoyed the wilderness areas as you have no doubt. I am speaking to urge you to include the Selkirk Crest, the Salmo-Priest area, and the Long  Canyon area ideally suited for wilderness use. And I would also ask  you to proceed with great caution on Idaho&#39;s roadless lands.  I think that should we decide to harvest those timbered lands, we  should look to the need at the time of the harvest rather than just  making a decision now that will be binding in the future. We&#39;veâ€”  as Mr. Reed made a statement earlier, we&#39;ve made many mistakes  in government and I would like to echo that sentence.  Second, it makes good economic sense to include wilderness in  northern Idaho. The use of the Salmo area, an area I&#39;m most familiar with, has seen increased use in the past 13, 14 years. Considerable increased use in the past 13, 14 years. It is not just a few  people. It&#39;s very difficult to go up there on the weekend in the  summer and not see other parties. So I would ask you to keep that  in mind when youâ€”when you make this proposal.  When it comes to economic sense, we must look at what brings  people to Idaho. As a boy growing up in New York, I have viewed  Idaho for its wilderness. We came to Idahoâ€”those of us who were  not nativesâ€”bringing our skills and our professions thinking of a     beautiful place to live. Not so much thinking of some of the clearcut areas that have been questioningly managed in the past.","Thank you very much.

Thank you for your response. And all of the responses that I received were encouraging because they supported a final decision  which hasn&#39;t been made yet, but that would be in the best interest  of Idaho and the rest of the Nation. A decision that will have positive long-term impact on our social and economic future.  The last year I participated in a graduate program at Eastern  Washington University. And we collected some data from this area  and people in this area. And the study concluded that the economic  faith of this area is shifting from a resource-based economy, forest  products, to a service-based economy led by tourism and recreation.  Statistics indicated that a higher retirement populations resides in  this area and that a labor force shift is going on to more of a service-based economy. People with a high need to recreate and spend     money.  In fact, every tourist there, the study says, that drops $1, that  dollar turns itself over six times. And every time I go up there and  spend money, I&#39;m thinking about that.  But I think what I&#39;m saying is that this study supports a high  utilization of the recreational opportunities like Long Canyon. And  in the best interest of our future, I advocate that this canyon be  protected and that it&#39;s left to its natural state to be enjoyed by us  and our children.",Thank you very much.

Thank you. Thank you, Senator McClure. My name  is Laurie Mauser. And I&#39;m an 11-year resident of Coeur d'Alene  and a fourth or fifth generation native of Idaho from eastern  Idaho.  I am opposed totally to quick and permanent decisions on Idaho&#39;s  wilderness and roadless areas. I am adamantly opposed to roadless  areas being released for other that wilderness designation. My understanding is that road construction both indirectly and directly  threatens the existence of viable fish and game populations. Road  construction to facilitate logging or other commercial operations  both increase human access and causes increased stream siltation  where soils are unstable as well as general scenic degradation. And  roads are expensive. I would prefer funds for any proposed federally funded roads be spent otherwise. Limited use of designated and  existing roadless areas make these areas far more valuable to me  even though I may never see or step foot in any of them. I hold in  high value the untouched or nearly untouched solitude of Idaho&#39;s  scenic wonder, thriving populations of big game and nongame animals, and fish populations as well.  I heartily endorse porposals to preserve the more than 3.8 million acres of designated wilderness and proposals to designate more     wilderness in the State&#39;s 6.5 million acres of roadless areas. These  areas have been roadless and in most cases untouched for thousands of years prior to Idaho&#39;s settlement. There is no hurry now to  determine how these lands will be managed for the future. If,  indeed, it is important now to decide, then this can only mean that  these lands must be special and preservation, then, is tantemount.

So I&#39;ve never heardâ€”it&#39;s classified already as a roadless area. It encroaches a spectacular piece. The numerous mountain lakes, meadows located in the subalpine type. Classification received wide support. The Governor and land board of the State of  Idaho gave strong support and commanded the Pioneer area concept. The Pioneer areaâ€”area can be reached easily by ordinary  citizens. And this is what we&#39;re interested in when setting this up  with the opportunity of enjoying this rare beauty by backpacking  over a single weekend.  I favor retention of this present classification of 30,500 acres of  roadless area that we have now and oppose wilderness areas proposed by the Forest Service in 1979.

Good afternoon. My name is Peter Wagstaff and  I am an attorney in private practice here in Coeur d'Alene. I am  speaking on my own behalf today.  First I would like to stress my support for Federal wilderness  designation for the following areas in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest, Salmo-Priest, Long Canyon, Selkirk Crest, Scotchman&#39;s  Peak, and the Mallard-Larkin. I further support the wilderness  designation throughout the remainder of Idaho proposed by the  Idaho Conservation League.  Second, I would like to urge you, Senator McClure, to formulate  any Idaho wilderness bill in conjunction with the Senators from  Washington and Montana so that wilderness designation is resolved for those areas which strattle the State line. I refer in particular to the Salmo-Priest and Scotchman&#39;s Peak areas. Both of  these regions were recommended for wilderness by the U.S. Forest  Service in RARE II.  The office of Senator Baucus of Montana has told me that the  Idaho side of the Scotchman&#39;s Peak area will not be considered by  the Montana omnibus bill, which is still in its drafting stages. That  area encompasses Scotchman&#39;s Peak itself together with a number     of other mountains in the Scotchman&#39;s proposed wilderness area.  Therefore, this region should be considered as part of any Idaho  wilderness bill.  The Washington delegation has recently proposed Senate bill 837  which will consider for wilderness the Salmo-Priest area recommended by the Forest Service for wilderness in RARE II. But as I  understand it, that bill will not consider the Salmo-Priest area on  the Idaho side of the forest. As a result, both these areas require  consideration by our delegation through any Idaho wilderness bill.  I would strongly urge you to work jointly with the WashingtonMontana delegations in formulating an Idaho wilderness bill which  encompasses both these regions. It would be embarrassing to all of  us if we allowed all or part of these spectacular areas to be overlooked simply because we expected the citizens and congressional  delegations from other States to do our work for us.

Personally I think it is offensive that I have to  come here and feel like I&#39;m begging for wilderness lands when  really it is essential to not only the quality of life, which I and  many others live, and also which is extremely important to hear  testimony about to the economy of the State; that is, the whole industry of tourism.  I chose to come back here after numerous years of school and  practicing law in California. I came back here because of the quality of life which I enjoy and which my parents before me enjoyed.  My father graduated from Sandpoint High School in about 1925.  I thinkâ€”and this is part of what I contained in my written statementâ€”the cry by the timber industry for more land should be addressed by you with a hard look at their practices. Examples of 5year delinquency in tree replanting after clear-cutting, deficit sales,  unnecessary roads, and general poor management. I&#39;m not saying  these are universal practices, but I&#39;m saying let&#39;s keep our eyes  open and take a look at them.  To be frank, I want as much wilderness as we can get. I want  included the full RARE II proposal on the Mallard-Larkin, I want  the Clearwater drainage and Snow Peak. I want Salmo-Priest  whether or not that land is included in the Washington bill. I don&#39;t  392  feel we should be dependent upon that. I want Long Canyon and  Scotchman Peak and Selkirk Crest.

Instead of justifying wilderness designations, which in effect amount to leaving  undesecrated what God created, we should be addressing here is we  have wilderness. Why should it be descreated by the multiple use  activities of the large corporate timber interests and the large corporate mining interests?  In effect, what this hearing amounts to is an attempt by you,  Senator, to give some semblance of credibility and legitimacy to  forthcoming legislation which will inevitably favor the extracted  and destructed corporate interests.  I know that in your breeder reactor heart y&gt;u have little concern  for God's creation and man&#39;s last refuge from an intrusive Federal     Government wilderness.

I also  ask that the area be enlarged to the east to include the Collins  Creek and Heather Creek drainages.  Collins Creek is in a deep canyon so rugged that it takes several  hours to traverse only a few miles of the creek. The land is so steep  on both sides of the creek that it would, I think, take up a strip of  side hill half a mile wide just to simply build a road along it.  The creek and entire drainage are incredibly beautiful but also  very vulnerable to destruction.  In addition, the Fish and Game Department has named Collins  one of the finest few remaining spawning beds for cutthroat trout.  So I would endorse all the wilderness that Idaho can get.

I would like to compliment you,  Senator McClure, and your staff on these hearings and thank you  for coming out here. They&#39;ve been very smooth, well done. And it&#39;s  been a pleasure to participate in them.  I would like to, I guess, start out by saying that my family&#39;s been  here in the Northwest for a very long time. They came out in the  1960&#39;s to the edge of Montana and the Spokane Valley and have  been here ever since. And thatâ€”myselfâ€”I grew up here. And I  have traveled some. And that when I traveled and I have lived  other places that people always say, &#39;What are you doing out of  the Pacific Northwest? Why would you come to the east coast when  you come from such a wonderful place?&#39; And they&#39;re talking about  the very type of wonderful things that are expressed and preserved  in the wilderness. The clean water, the fish, the mountains, the  wildlife. And they don&#39;t have those things in many other places.  And I think that it is our responsibility as Idahoans and as Americans to preserve those areas that are only here and are unique to  Idaho.  I would also like to make a point that wilderness is multiple use.  It doesn&#39;t knock up anything. It doesn&#39;t prevent you from doing  very many things in those areas. You can r11 more in wilderness     than you can do in a national park. In fact, there are only a couple  of things that you really can&#39;t do which includes logging and building roads.  Also, once areas are designated by Congress as wilderness, they  tend to be used even more greatly. They become greater attractions  for recreationists, hunters, fishermen, hikers, campers, whatever.  And by designating some of the roadless acreage on the Clearwater  National Forest more wilderness that we will, in fact, increase the  recreational industry as well as increase taxes that come from that  industry.

Good afternoon; can you hear me? Senator  McClure, Senator Symms, it&#39;s nice to see you. And I hopeâ€”thank  you for holding these hearings. I hope you&#39;ll have some time to  spend enjoying some of the natural beauties of Idaho before you  have to return to Washington. Maybe you could take Mr. Bevinetto  fishing in Kelly Creek.  I have a statement today from Mr. Art Rourke who resides in  Moscow that I&#39;d like to read for the record. The Kelly Creek drainage should be maintained  without further logging and further road construction. This drain-  age is used in northern Idaho. The drainage deserves special con-  sideration because of its aesthetics and its natural fisheries.  745  Neither of these aspects, however, makes the drainage unique.  What makes this specific drainage special in northern Idaho is its  accessibility.  Wilderness preservation does have a fair amount of roadless area  that provides both beauty and fine fishing. Most of these areas are  not readily accessible to the young and the not so young because of  the hiking required.  Northern Idaho needs at least one wilderness area that offers  aesthetics and fine fishing to all age groups and occupations.  I note from personal experience that children as young as four  can easily hike up Kelly Creek. I also know from personal experi-  ence that folks who have seen their 88th winter can also hike the  Kelly Creek drainage without difficulty. It is past time to offer  these two special age groups special consideration.  I urge the committee to adopt regulations that will preserve  Kelly Creek so that my children&#39;s children and their grandparents  can enjoy wilderness areas. No dollar value has been calculated for  such experiences. Forest Service has errored in this regard. They  have alsoâ€”they have errored, too, in considering logging that area  that offers little in the way of valuable timber and a great deal in  the way of recreation.  Now, you had some questions earlier about the roads that went  through there. I think that there are ways to get around that.  There are several areas that have what they call cherry stems into     an area. And, then, also it would be possible to make two separate  wilderness areas.  Thank you very much.","We made progress from the last hearing. Now

I&#39;m from Cobalt; I worked for the mine; I was promised a job for 20 years and was laid off without notice. Mining is rarely a stable industry.  What industry does stand self-supportive and growing? Well, Senator, it&#39;s recreation. Logging, mining, and agriculture, though necessary, are all subsi dized and therefore on the corporate welfare system. By asking for 90 percent of the remaining forest lands, the timber industry is saying we need more trees in order to be self-supportive and healthy. Timber industry, you already have trees that are back  699     logged. The public in the long run pays for roads; the Government sells you trees at a loss; and you still can&#39;t make it. There are areas set aside as roadless wilderness; however, if we leave them as our only roadless areas, they will eventually suffer from over-use, over-recreation. Recreation does not need roads; it can grow and thrive on our abundance of wild lands. Undeveloped and basically undisturbed, wilderness is a land with  clean water, an abundance of native fish, feeding grounds for the still large herds of elk and deer. It is a nonrenewable resource, not just for Idahoans to enjoy, but people throughout the world and for generations to come. Once it&#39;s opened to the first stages of develop ment, it&#39;s gone. I don&#39;t want hard release language used when this bill is written up. I don&#39;t want to see areas not classified now to be permanently banned from ever being considered wilderness. I do want to see the endangered Idaho wilderness core included in this legislation. I do want to see more than 50 percent of the re maining roadless land be protected as wilderness. We need to keep our wilderness as a part of the heritage of the past. Future generations should have the right to have a wilder ness experience.

Hello, Senator. My name is Jeffery Coulter. I&#39;m a  resident of Clark Fork, and an owner of Action Camera Repair  Business in Clark Fork.  In my testimony I would like to support the following areas for  wilderness designation: in the Idaho Panhandle Forest, Salmo  Priest area, the Selkirk Crest, Long Canyon, and Scotchman&#39;s  Peak.  I will begin by telling you of an area that I&#39;m very familiar with  because it&#39;s in my backyard. I support the entire 20,720 acres that  were recommended in the RARE II process for the Scotchman&#39;s  Peak area. In addition to important wildlife habitat, this beautiful  area supports grizzly bears, mountain goats, moose, and other large  game.  The economic and recreational aspects of Scotchman&#39;s are important to me and many other of my fellow Clark Fork residents.  Recreationally, Scotchman&#39;s draws hunters, backpackers, and  day packers to the community. As a small businessman, I want to  protect those values to insure the Scotchman&#39;s is placed in a wilderness to help create a broad based economic growth in our area.  The 20,720 acres proposal has no negative aspects with regard to     our community, which has been primarily involved in logging and  mining to this point.  Recreation represents a much more stable aspect for our economy than both logging and mining that erratically support our community at this point, depending on the metal prices and the timber  demand.  The timber resource of Scotchman&#39;s are limited, and not very accessible. The timber is much more valuable as a resource and a  component of the wilderness areas.  Wilderness will be able to support the local economy for years to  come in a stable manner unlike extracted resources.  Thank you, Senator.","Thank you very much.

Senator, ladies and gentlemen of the panel, I am Lenore Barrett. My husband and I and our family live in Challis, Idaho, county seat of Custer County. My husband works on the na tional forest. Bless his little heart, he&#39;s been a good provider. Frankly, I would like to sustain him in that capacity. You have already heard testimony from Senator Vearl Crystal and Representative Jo An Wood as to the negative impact that an  additional wilderness would have on our worldly economy. I would like to just comment here that Representative Wood, Senator Crys tal, and Representative Ray Infanger right here from district 20 have the support of the majority of the people in the district; they won our elections. I do not therefore propose to elaborate on their already submitted and very excellent testimony. I would like to reemphasize that Custer County needs its natural resource industries. Contrary to the image being created by the en vironmentalists, resource industries do not pilfer from public lands. They only supply the demand. No demand, no supply. In further opposition, I would also mention that our existing re source industries in the county, large and small, do manage to produce under the multiple-use concept and the close scrutiny of multiple State and Federal agencies, but it is somewhat akin to mashing all the toes on one foot; you can still walk but you limp a lot. Even so, the frying pan is better than the fire. Lastly, I do have a twinge of conscious when I am confronted by well-meaning people who are terrified that there will be no natural resources left for our subsequent generations. Then I recall the  694  story of the rich man who hoarded his abundant grain in his mag nificent barns. Satisfied that he had provided adequately for his future, he could now take his ease; he proceeded to eat, drink, and be merry, only to hear the inevitable pronouncement, thou fool, this night thou soul shall be required of thee. We have no guarantees. If my family can keep from starving today, maybe we will be able to repeat the same success tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. The bell has not rung. I must add this P.S. prompted by some comments from the preceding panel. God did indeed create our wil derness area, He created the whole kit and caboodle in 6 days and rested on the 7th.

Senator McClure, and members of the  panel, my name is Terry Sverdsten. I&#39;m the present State Senator  from district 3 on which soil we are congregated here today. I am  also a logging contractor and have been involved in the industry  since the early forties. We employ some 110 employees in the  woods who also their livelihoods are dependent upon the income  from our national forest land. I am also a sportsman having bagged  my elk for about 27 times out of the last 29 years, so I&#39;m also an  outdoorsman and enjoy the exposure of trees, game, and the whole  ecosystem that we have in our national forest land.  As a result of that experience, I may have more experience than  most anyone else here today as far as the use of our national forest  lands. And I would like to rely on that experience on giving you a  brief summary of my experience. As a logger, my employees tell  me for the most part that they have never been in a wilderness  area, and that the only time they can be in the wilderness area is  an experience close to roads and access that they can reach on  weekends. Because of their work schedules, season work, they are  not able to use the wilderness areas in the summertime, and in essence, they are locked out of these areas.  Also, as a legislator I hear basically the same thing, that people  are not able to get into the wilderness areas. The only areas they  can use are those areas adjacent to roads, and they can use them  on weekends. As a result, they feel that the land is being taken  away from them rather than being used.  Senator McClure, I have given you a copy of my testimony, and,  of course, in 2 minute&#39;s time this morning, I will not be able to  review the whole thing. That will become part of the record.  4  I will just conclude by saying that many of my employees and  many of my constituents within this district are very disturbed of  the eroding tax base of private land. I have employees that live in  one county just across the line of Montana, and less than 15 percent of that land base is privately owned. Therefore, the burden of  taxes upon those people is very, very great. We do understand that  the Government has quite an aggressive program in buying land,  and, therefore, we do not feel that buying land and saving more  land for wilderness is the right approach for us who live in the  west.

I  own and operate a contract logging business and have worked as a  logger in Idaho since 1955.  I am indeed proud to represent the majority of loggers in the  State of Idaho. This group of people is more directly affected by  this issue than any other group in Idaho. We are pleased that you  have given us this opportunity to state our views here today.  I feel the majority of the now roadless areas in Idaho should be  released into the multiple use category. I also realize that this des   ignation does not necessarily mean these areas will be immediately  logged. On the contrary, there may be many acres that may never  be logged due to wildlife impact, water quality, recreational effects,  and many other priorities that responsible management designates.  Contrary to some beliefs, the Idaho logger does not have a goal of  cutting down every tree in the State of Idaho. On the other hand, it  is difficult to see the value of letting mature and valuable timber  go by the way of fire, blowdown, and disease to or obvious benefit  to anyone.  It is clearly evident that properly managed forests enhance the  recreational value rather than diminish it.  On the wilderness side, I believe the rest of the Nation should be  very proud of Idaho for its enormous contribution to the wilderness  system.  Is there no limit to the obligation the people of Idaho have to the  rest of the Nation, as to the amount of wilderness we must supply?

Senators, I&#39;d like to thank you for providing this op portunity to express my views on the issue of Idaho wilderness clas sification. First, the four proposals outlined in Senator McClure&#39;s  mailing. I prefer Proposal 4. Furthermore, I endorse the protection of the endangered Idaho wilderness core sponsored by the Audubon Society, ICL and other. As a point of departure, I believe wilderness greatly enhances the quality of life in Idaho for very many of us. Not only for those of use who actually can visit the lands, but also for many others who appreciate the protection of these lands vicariously. Just knowing they&#39;re there is part of what makes Idaho so special. As Idaho continues to grow and as outdoor recreation becomes ever more popular, I believe it is essential to bring greater amounts of land within the wilderness system to prevent the overuse and deterioration of existing wilderness. I especially believe wilderness classifications near Bosie are essential for this purpose. Furthermore, I would urge Senator McClure to include a provi sion to allow further review of lands not included in legislation pre pared at this time. Because the resource extraction industries seem not to have the problem of too little land available to them, but rather too much land already leased, there seems to be no gain by making irreversible choices today, especially since waiting 15 years could provide us with important information about the timber in dustry and the recreational demands of this State.

We oppose any additions of land to the wilderness and roadless  areas and will support efforts to reduce the amount of land in wilderness status in Idaho.  Some of the people who support wilderness areas are of a nogrowth lobby who support the idea of a ban-the-people movement  to remote areas of our State. They have the deeprooted thought  that trees, flowers, and animals are more desirable than man. And  if they had their druthers, perhaps we would end up with a population that consists of 47 human beings and 200 million snail darters.  They are determined to accomplish these objectives at whatever  cost to society.  Such public lands are enormous in scope. They comprise about  one-third of the area of this country.

Thank you, Senator McClure. Once again, I&#39;m representing the Wilderness Society. I would like to direct my testi mony to the oil and gas controversy today. In 1982 the economic policy department of the Wilderness Socie ty worked together with Economic Associates, Inc., of Washington, DC. to assess the potential productivity of Federal lands for oil and gas development. The following is a summary of our findings. I do have extra summaries of this report. Potentially producible oil and gas is all oil and gas still in the ground likely to be considered economically producible, not neces sarily produced over a long-range future. The most appropriate al ready existing proxy measure of potentially producing oil and gas is the sum of the U.S. Geological Surveys estimate of identified re serves and undiscovered recoverable resources.  Identified reserves include proven reserves demonstrated by actual drilling, amounts that can be inferred to exist in the same general areas from the evidence provided by such drilling, and additional amounts of dem onstrated oil and gas that are not now economic to recover but which are projected to become recoverable. Undiscovered recover able resources are based on geological extrapolation from known areas and on speculation regarding geological formations likely to yield producible oil and gas. According to this study, potential wilderness, which is made up of land that Federal agencies have either recommended as suitable for wilderness designation or has under consideration for wilder ness, contains only 3.4 percent of all potentially producible oil and gas and only 2.5 percent of all potentially producible gas. I&#39;m sorry, the first figure was oil, the second was gas. There are approximately 148 million acres of potential wilder ness in the United States, and nearly 60 percent of this land is in Alaska. The proportion of oil and gas in potential wilderness areas is substantially higher in Alaska than in the 48 contiguous States. Of all the potentially producible oil and gas in the Western Overthrust Belt, only 4.8 percent is located on potential wilderness iden  605  tified as Forest Service, National Park Service, and Fish and Wild life Service areas endorsed as suitable BLM WSA&#39;s and further planning areas. Given this information, I believe it would be premature to re     lease areas such as the Palisades unless adequate studies have been completed or unless there is overwhelming evidence that this area contains large oil and gas reserves, and that these resource values are greater than other resource values.

I even missed Star Trek. The results  were 61 more votes for wilderness, and 45 more for multiple use.  Although I have not talked to every citizen in my district, I believe we would favor setting the ridge-to-ridge part of Long Canyon  as wilderness.

I ranch just south of Long Canyon and at the foot of the Selkirk  Mountains. I have ridden horseback the e. tire length of Long  Canyon and much of the Selkirk Crest. I&#39;m a hunter, fisherman,     and consider myself a conservationist in the full sense of the word  and believe multi use is the only way to manage the balance of our  forest.  As a commissioner spending the past 3 weeks on our county  budget, I realize how important the forest revenue is to our economy. I don&#39;t believe we can afford to tie up large areas of timber  forever but they best serve the most by multi-use.  With a &#39;Wilderness&#39; classification and the reduction of the allowable harvest, the financial problems of our county and schools  would be compounded. Just a few years ago our county received  over $500,000 from the 25 percent fund of forest revenue. This past  year this was cut to $156,000. If the allowable harvest was reduced  our roads would suffer even more than they have and it would  become financially impossible to return them to the level of past  years.  As a rancher, I believe in conserving all of our natural resources.  We utilize all resources on our ranch including the straw in the  fields. I can&#39;t support leaving mature trees to rot, or worse yet, becoming fuel for a forest fire. I believe there are ways of harvesting  these mature trees without harming the environment. I would support snow roads and road and road closures after harvesting the  timber.  I believe I enjoy the mountains and outdoors as much as any  person in this room but feel the best managaement of our forest is  where the most people can be served.","Thank you very much.

I am Darrell Kerby, acting mayor and president of  the Bonners Ferry City Council. I am offering the following testimony on behalf of the city of Bonners Ferry, Idaho. In my packet  you will find a copy of Bonners Ferry Resolution No. 83-4, which  passed unanimously, stating that the city supports multiple use  management for the Long Canyon area and a continuation of the  1971 Joint State of Idahoâ€”U.S. Forest Service Management Plan  for the Selkirk Crest.  Over the past several years we have become increasingly  alarmed over the slow methodical loss of this economic base, the  national forest land, to single use rather than multiple use.  The effect of this acreage being removed out of timber production  is fairly dramatic. For the past years the annual allowable harvest  have been determined by taking into consideration the total  annual growth in a given area. As this production area decreased  by the removing of thousands of acres, the total annual growth also  declines. This, of course, causes the annual allowable harvest to decline by the amount of production removed, but it has a further  complication in that itâ€”the annual harvestâ€”not only has to be reduced for the acreage no longer available, but has to be reduced  low enough to take care of the overcutting that has taken place  over the last 40 to 50 years when these areas had been included in  the timber resource base.  Long Canyon and its adjacent drainages of Fisher, Farnum, and  Parker Creek amounted to 83,903 acres. The Long Canyon portion  of this acreage is slightly over 20,000 acres. The Long Canyon area  12  has one of the highest site indicesâ€”55 to 80â€”in Boundary County.  This is a reading showing the height growth of new timber in 50  years. Long Canyon is definitely a highly desirable commercial  area for lumber production.  Is our area lacking wilderness recreation experience? No; 25,000  acres have already been set aside in the Boulder Creek area of  Boundary County for primitive recreation. Approximately 40 miles  southeast of Bonners Ferry there exists the already congressionally  designated wilderness area known as the Cabinet Mountain Wilderness comprising 94,272 acres. All in all, there exists today  6,694,522 acres of wilderness proclaimed by Congress within 1 day&#39;s  drive of Bonners Ferry. How much is enough? As far as our State  is concerned, of all 50 States, Idaho is first in the percent of national forests lands already proclaimed as wilderness. In total acreage  in proclaimed wilderness areas, Idaho is second only to the State of  Alaska.  This issue, as we see it, is not wilderness versus clearcut. We see  multiple purpose","Thank you.

Senator, my name is Mike Karnes. I was born and  raised in Boundary County. Since 1963 I have been working in the  woods. In 1970 I started my own logging company. For the past 20  to 25 years, I have hunted, fished, hiked, snowmobiled and camped  on virtually every part of the areas being considered here.  It is my opinion that neither Long Canyon nor the Selkirk Crest  should be designated for wilderness.  Let&#39;s consider first the Selkirk Crest. In 1971 the U.S. Forest  Service and the State of Idaho entered into a management agreement for the Selkirk Crest, which this agreement is exhibit 1 in my  written testimony. In this agreement, it stated clearly that this  area should remain roadless in a near natural condition for back  country recreation. It also stated there shall be no harvesting of  timber. I wholeheartedly concur with this.  I would highly recommend that the Selkirk Crest be left under  the present agreement, so that the Forest Service would be ble to  manage adjacent timber stands, protect the crest and adjacent  18  areas from fire without the hindrances caused by designated wilderness.  Many people including myself, ride snowmobiles in this area several times each year. Due to the snow depth, 7 to 9 feet plus, no  damage occurs. In 15 years of riding snowmobiles on the Selkirk  Crest area, we have yet to see any big game roaming. If it were  designated wilderness, snowmobiling would be prohibited.  Next, let us look at Long Canyon. Many estimates have been  made as to the timber volume included in this area. It is my opinion that there is between 300 to 400 million board feet of saw logs.",,MIKE KARNES,"ASSOCIATED LOGGING, CONTRACTORS, BONNERS FERRY, IDAHO",Karnes,Mike,h2d1,"karnes, mike",Boundary County (COUNTY); the Selkirk Crest (LANDFORM); Idaho (STATE); Selkirk (LANDFORM); Selkirk Crest (LANDFORM); Long Canyon (LANDFORM),text

Good morning, Senator. I&#39;d like to summarize basi   cally what I have in my prepared statement.  I&#39;ve lived in Bonners Ferry for 24 years, and for 22 of those I&#39;ve  made a hobby, you might say, of exploring the Selkirk Mountain  area in general. I feel that the Selkirk Crest as originally proposed  by the Forest Service has omitted some important areas. There are  four areas that I believe are in the Eneas Ridge, which is primarily  State lands: Fisher Ridge, which is Government landâ€”U.S. Government land, which also includes the highest peak in north Idaho,  which would be appropriate for the crest; Smith Ridge, which contains three fine peaks and two great lakes: Smith Lake, Cutoff  Lake, and Lake Peaks; and Long Canyon, which lies between Smith  ridge and Parker Ridge, and should naturally be a part of the Selkirk Crest.  Some people argue that there sould be no wilderness at all in  Boundary County, and I feel that a lot of the people who say that  feel that by so doing, we will keep wilderness hidden from the rest  of the country. And I feel that doing such a thing is wrong. An enlightened society should show to all its members what areas we  have available for their different uses, and any attempt to hide  places in our system is a form of greed in no other manner.  I believe that the Selkirk Crest deserves wilderness protection  and identification, and Long Canyon along with it.

Senator McClure, my name is Jan Wathen. I live  in Bonners Ferry, and I&#39;ve been hiking the mountains of Boundary  County for quite a few years now.  This summer I&#39;ve been a forage backpacking leader. That&#39;s quite  an experience. There are 42 kids enrolled in backpacking in Boundary County, and I have 11 in my group. There are city kids and  farm kids, and they are all learning many new things by being out  in the wilderness. One of the things that I want to share with them  is the experience of hiking and camping in Long Canyon. It&#39;s such  a unique place. There&#39;s really no other place like it in Boundary  County or probably all of north Idaho. It&#39;s kind of steep to get into,  and for that reason I don&#39;t know why anybody would really want  to put roads into it. But there&#39;sâ€”it&#39;s just like a rain forest in there,  it&#39;s just beautiful. You should see it. And because of that, I feel  that that should become wilderness.  This summer I also hiked the Selkirk Crest, and that was a great  experience, too. The views were beautiful, but one of the sort of sad  things about it was that most of the views included roaded and  logged areas. At the end of the hike we came out Parker Ridge,  and one of the great things was to be able to see Long Canyon in  38  its entirety with its trees. So, I think, that you should consider that  it&#39;s just really a very small portion of north Idahoâ€”Long Canyon  and Selkirk Crestâ€”and the monetary gains just can&#39;t make up for  the other things that it has to offer.

My name is Ray Newcombe, and I&#39;m a practicing  physician in Bonners Ferry. At this time I plan to quickly summarize my feelings regarding wilderness areas for Boundary County.  I believe Long Canyon and Selkirk Crest should be designated as  wilderness. The first point I would like to address is that on the  issue update sent to some but not all Idaho citizens. The information you receive in this questionnaire is not completely valid and  should not be used in determining public opinion. Not all citizens  got questionnaires. I for one did not receive one, and I have written  to you on numerous occasions, and, therefore, your office should  have my address. I know of many other people who favor preserving Long Canyon who also did not receive a questionnaire, and  these people have written to you expressing their views on Long  Canyon, and, therefore you should have their address, also.  These omissions will result in biased data leading toward not  making Long Canyon wilderness.  Second, proposals on the questionnaire do not do justice to those  of us wishing to see Long Canyon designated wilderness. The  choices between proposals 3 and 4 result in choosing between  asking for an excessive amount of wilderness land or not including     Long Canyon as wilderness.  More specifically, proposal 3 does not include Long Canyon, and  this proposal asks for a 1-million acre increase in wilderness lands  of Idaho. Then, the questionnaire jumps to proposal 4, which contains Long Canyon, but also contains many other areas resulting in  a total proposal of 4 V2 million acres. Therefore, if someone wants to  include Long Canyon in your Wilderness bill, then they must select  proposal 4 which is too uncompromising. This will label or designate those people as being radical environmentalists who are  asking for too much. This is another method of steering your data  to favor the timber industry.  My next point is concerning the amount of timberlands in  Idahoâ€”I&#39;m sorry, concerning the amount of wilderness land in  Idaho. In a letter you sent to me on January 25, 1983, you stated,  quote, &#39;Now the major question for Idaho in regard to land designations: How much wilderness is enough?&#39; unquote.","Thank you very much.

We are grateful for the  peace and beauty we are able to enjoy here. We live 7 miles out of  124  town from Bonners Ferry, with a panoramic view of the Selkirks  Crest Mountains, about 12 miles west from us.  Long Canyon in its natural state, not touched by machines and  chainsaws consequently is a blessing for wildlife and for man, also.  As senior citizens of this county we enjoy the outdoors and the  physical fitness which comes with it. If we are willing to discipline  ourselves and enjoy nature as it comes from the Creator&#39;s hand  and believe that the physical, mental, and spiritual value of having  areas like Long Canyon as wilderness area set aside, would outweigh by far the economic values.  Long Canyon could be a great attraction for out-of-town visitors,  who would gain relief from stress by spending time in nature.  Nature is the other great lesson book of our Creator.

This is an aerial photomap of the northwest corner of Bonners  Ferry Ranger District; Long Canyon untouched forests running on     the bottom of the canyon surrounded by areas that are unproductive or unsuitable for logging. Long Canyon is the natural forest  corridor to connect the valley floor down here with the Selkirk  Crest and runs to the top of the ridge up here.  I favor Long Canyon as being a forest wilderness. I think we  need to establish a forest wilderness to connect the valley with the  alpine community up above. It&#39;s a unique forest community that  we have here in north Idaho centering around Bonners Ferry for  about a 50 to 75 miles radius.  To the north of us, northwest you can see the multiple use area  of Smith Creek and Boundary Creek and the surrounding drainages that adjoin into there. Many roads have been constructed into  that area for logging roads, and many sights have been logged in  that. Roads seem to be expanding over the last 10 years at a pretty  good rate. I&#39;ve updated the map to about 1982 on the roads. The  clearcuts here that are in white have been updated to about 1979.  As you can see, there are roads now approaching Long Canyon  right on up to the crest, and there&#39;s been logging right at the very  crest edge of Long Canyon. This is multiple use, and what makes it  multiple use really is logging, it&#39;s roads, clearcuts, it&#39;s disturbing  the watersheds, and disturbing the wildlife. A start difference between Long Canyon here and multiple use, but let&#39;s look at it a  little bit further.","When we receive this material it will be made a

Hello. I&#39;m Barbara Binnall from Bonners Ferry.  The reason I am here today voicing my hopes for the designation  of Long Canyon as wilderness area is that I am a mother. As a  mother of two sons, I want my children and my grandchildren to  have the privilege tomorrow of seeing pristine virgin land which I  can see today. I want to protect at least a small part of God's creation from man&#39;s industrious hand so that my children and other  children can experience the awe and the peace that unsullied  nature brings.     I believe that one of our unique human attributes is that we are  moved when we see something naturally beautiful, be it a wildflower or an ancient cedar, a clear stream or a mighty ocean.  Something in us rings clear and true, we know that this is good.  We sense something of God's goodness. Our soles are ennobled, and  we become refreshed from the healing powers of nature, and we  can go back to face the hectic and often crazy work-a-day world.  I question the logic and the ethic of the thought process which  sees a tree only in the terms of dollars and cents. It is my understanding that the trees of Long Canyon represent only a small 2.9  percent of Boundary County&#39;s marketable timber. Consequently, if  these 100- to 200-year-old trees of Long Canyon were protected in a  wilderness area for future generations, it would be no great loss to  the logging community. And if in the passing of time beetles or  fires or fungus should destroy the trees, then that, too, would be a  small loss to the economy.  Furthermore, if the beetle or fires did finally destroy the trees,  and that could be human generations from now, at least we  humans could appreciate and learn from the natural growth and  order which has stood or changed for the test of time.","Thank you very much.

I have a couple of questions. I&#39;ll address the first to Dave Brown.

Dave, are you familiar with Parker Creek and Fish Creek drain-

ages?

Mr. Brown. Parker, andâ€”no, not Fish.

The Chairman. And is Parker Creek a wilderness condition at

the present time?

Mr. Brown. Yes, it is. It&#39;s right in this area right here. This is

Parker Canyon, a small canyon or medium-size canyon.

Long Canyon is up here in the long-range photo. This is a satel-

lite photo, and we see Long Canyon as one of the few canyons left

along this border that hasn&#39;t been touched by logging.

It looks like a checkerboard square across here.

The Chairman. Parker Creek is the adjacent drainage?

Mr. Brown. Right here. Here is Parker Creek, here is Long

Canyon.

The Chairman. And Fisher Creek would be the next drainage

from that?

Mr. Brown. It may be this little one here.

The Chairman. You&#39;re not familiar with Fisher Creek?

Mr. Brown. No, I&#39;m not.

The Chairman. All right. Thank you.

Dr. Newcombe, I appreciate the fact that you made some criti-

cism of the mailing list because I&#39;m constantly concerned about

more accurate to make sure that people that have written in that

can be sure the staff will hear about it. Thank you.

I&#39;m a teacher from  Bonners Ferry, Idaho.  My major concern in the wilderness issue is that we not make a  hasty decision, and that we not be so presumptuous as to try to  settle the wilderness issue once and for all. I feel that it is an ongoing decisionmaking process, and that we don&#39;t have to have the  right to make decisions for future generations.  I have two reasons for this: One is that I feel historically we  haven&#39;t done a very good job of protecting future needs. In 1867  Secretary of State Seward spent $7 million on what everyone  thought was a frozen wasteland. Today Alaska is one of our greatest assets.  On the opposite side, I don&#39;t think we have done a very good job  of protecting what consequences our land usage will have. We&#39;ve     washed topsoil from some of America&#39;s best farmlands, put dioxin  on our roads and rendered communities uninhabitableâ€”the list  goes on and on. This is not just environmentalist dribble. These are  cases listed in my paper which have been recognized by the Federal Government. We have always forged ahead with good economic  and technological developments without really predicting the consequences.  A second concern I have is why we are ignoring supply and  demand. My research shows that there&#39;s a 17-year surplus of coal,  a 3-year surplus of lumber, a surplus of oil, and that the population  rate is declining. To me, this means that our demand will probably  go down, and to ignore this seems really foolish to me.  I have two recommendations. The first is that some land be established as permanent wilderness. The second is that the remaining land in question be established under a current wilderness  status to be left untouched until resource needs demand its use.  The status of this land could be reviewed every 10 to 20 years.  I cannot justify using it unless it really is in demand in taking  that right away from future generations. I feel that such determinations should be made by the people directly affected by the decision and not us, 20 or 30 or 40 years ahead of time.",,ANNE REMALEY,"BONNERS FERRY, IDAHO",Remaley,Anne,h2d1,"remaley, anne",Bonners Ferry (CITY); Alaska (STATE); America (COUNTRY),text

I have lived in Bonners Ferry for  almost 24 years. We came here from the Midwest in search of  living away from the city and closer to nature. There are many  other in Boundary County like us.  There are many uses of the wilderness without including lumber.  My sons are lovers of the mountains, one lost his life in them. It  did not curtail the others from pursuing the same love. They have  climbed the peaks and know them well, more so than many longtime residents. They have utilized the mountains for practical and  aesthetic purposes, hunting, fishing, huckleberrying, mushrooming,  as well as for photography, recreation, and studying, and solitude.  They have brought back to the public their findings in the form  of slide shows, wood sculptures, art objects, photographs, and  custom-made signs which they sell in their shop. There are others  like that who appreciate nature, and who have the ingenuity to do  something else besides depending on the lumbering business.  Diversity is a necessity in a small mining or lumbering town.     These places can dwindle and die from lack of imagination. I know  that from experience. I was raised in the Upper Peninsula of  Michigan. I can appreciate the needs of lumbermen. My father  worked mining and lumbering.

Senator McClure, my name is Howard Monks, Jr.  I&#39;m a most-of-my-life resident of Bonners Ferry, and I was born  there in 1917.  I would like to speak specifically in support of the Selkirk Crest,  Long Canyon wilderness idea. I feel that this area contains a very  small percentage of the logging basis of the Forest Service plan in  Boundary County, and the loss of this small amount can more than  be made up in the long run by a vigorous exploitation of the area  as a tourist attraction.  My appeal is simply that if we are to err in our decisions about  the future of the areas like this, let us err in the area of conservatism, and let us make that mistake and we can change that later.  But if we logged it, we&#39;re out of luck for a long time to come.  Thank you.","Thank you.

Today I&#39;d like to say a little something about  changes, and my attitude about change is that it&#39;s gross, and I&#39;d  like my statements heard in that vein.  I&#39;m not against timber management or logging, and I appreciate  the safeguards that protect our public lands from indiscriminate  logging. This lends itself to even protect the logging industry. However, I feel the Forest Service has as its management priority a  timber-only attitude, and I would like to have equal value considerations given to other areas of forest management.  Forests have more than just a monetary value, and that&#39;s only  one aspect. I do not agree with plans to keep on logging especially  when it&#39;s not even economical. This practice imposes an unfair  kind of false economy on all of us who live in areas with a timber  based economy. Rather, I would like to see us change and grow by  diversifying our economic base.  I do not believe Long Canyon is more beneficial to our economy  for its timber than for its wilderness qualities. There are many  areas with timber attributes, but only one unroaded wild Long  Canyon.  I believe many elected officials are capable of changing their attitudes, and, in fact, have. And hopefully, I&#39;ll see the time when this  will come around.     Thank you.","Thank you.

Senator McClure, my name is Karen Samter. My  husband and I are homeowners in Bonners Ferry. I taught school  until our children were born. My husband has a degree in forestry  and shares my views regarding wilderness.  I favor designating all the areas in Idaho which meet the specifications of wilderness as wilderness. I am especially concerned that  Long Canyon be preserved as wilderness areas under the wilderness bill.  One of the reasons I advocate the importanceâ€”I advocate this is  the importance that the old-growth forests such as that found in  Long Canyon have in maintaining healthy and varied wildlife.  These uneven aged silva culturely over-mature stands exhibit a  high complexity and diversity of habitat. Snags and fallen trees are  critical.  A study done in the Blue Mountains indicates that snags are  used by 63 species of vertebrates, and downed trees by 179 species.  Snags are first used for nesting, then come the primary excavators  which make cavities for nests. These cavities are later used by  other birds and mammals as sites for courtship rituals, nesting, reproduction, and overwintering. Insects inhabiting the wood are     used as food. Downed trees provide sites for covers and productionâ€”protection, reproduction, feeding, and food storage.  The debris dams that are formed by fallen timber provide food  sources, cover from predators, and protective breeding areas for  fish.  To many species, the old growth forests offer optimum habitats.  To some, the spotted owl, the pileated woodpecker, and many  others, the old-growth forest is the only habitats. Without it, these  species will become extinct.  The preservation and enhancement of wildlife is worth it to us in  dollars brought into the State by hunters, fishermen, hikers, photographers, by the knowledge gained through the study of wildlife  in its undisturbed, preferred environment and the thrills that our  children might experience in seeing the wildlife itself.  As taxpayers, homeowners, and voters, my husband and I urge  you to preserve Long Canyon as wilderness.  Thank you.","Thank you.

I would like to quote from these letters briefly.  First a letter by a Bonners Ferry resident, Russell Michaelsen:  In discussing the relative merits of either the commercial viewpoint or the pro wil-  derness viewpoints, the ability to arrive at valid comparisons and truthful conclu-  sions is difficult because there is very little common language in which to discuss  the issues.  That&#39;s been evident here today.  I have been a logger, a mill hand, and a carpenter. I have also been a biochemist,  a medical technologist, and an active participant in the arts. I know that we are  finding many substitutes for wood in its traditional uses. We have never found a     substitute for whole nature.  The public lands of the United States of America are a heritage beyond immedi-  ate values.  Another letter by Steven McClosky, also of Bonners Ferry:  Far too often, economic concerns have dictated how our physical and mental ne-  cessities will be met. A fact of life. Nevertheless, it is extremely important for us as  a society to recognize that nature innate, such places as Long Canyon, must remain  intact.  Once used, nature, however managed, inevitably becomes abused.  Thank you.","

I&#39;ve been in most parts of Boundary county, either while fishing  or while doing summer work with the U.S. Forest Service or while  just driving around enjoying the beauty of the area. The economy  of Boundary County is principally based on the timber resource.  Probably 70 percent of the economy arises from that resource. Another 25 percent of our economy is founded on the agricultural resource. The remaining 5 percent comes from tourists and retirees.  In the past few years our annual allowable cut has been reduced  from 55 million board feet per year to about 35. This is a very serious reduction. Because the allowable cut is now so low, any further  cut of any kind courts disaster to us in Boundary County.  The public as a whole, and it&#39;s as I feel in our area, wants multiple use. This can be ascertained from the 1,500 letter writers and  petition signers that contacted the U.S. Forest Service on RARE II.

As chairperson of Boundary County School District  101, Bonners Ferry, I am presenting to you our resolution, approved unanimously by our five-member board on August 9, 1983,  in open session at our regularly scheduled public meeting.  Our resolution states that the economy of Boundary County directly affects the economy of local schools. The economy of Boundary County is dependent upon the timber natural resource. Boundary County School District depends upon in-lieu-of-tax forest funds  for educational equipment and transportation equipment. Reduction in the annual cut has already had a large negative impact  upon the school budget. The multiple-use concept would benefit all  citizens, and we support the multiple-use desgnation for the Long  Canyon area, and support the 1971 joint State of Idaho-U.S. Forest  Service plan for the Selkirk Crest.  There has been a sharp decline in forest funds revenue received  by our local district in the last 4 years: 1981 revenue was $212,000;  1981, revenue was $133,000; 1980, $148,000; and 1983, only $61,000,  with the major expenditures from these funds used for storage  areas for the high school, supplementing lunch programs, and  maintaining our schools, and mainly buying school buses.     Our county, which consists of only about 30 percent taxable property, has put undue burden on our taxpayers and is jeopardizing  our maintaining functional school facilities because of our loss of  forest funds revenue.  We feel Boundary County&#39;s most important resource, our children, are being overlooked by those considering putting all of the  forest lands surrounding them in a look-but-don&#39;t-touch status.

I am a professional conservationist, and am so listed by the Soil  Conservation Service. At present, I am a farmer and president of  the Kootenai Valley Reclamation Association, which represents  30,000 acres of farm land in the Kootenai Valley.  From the testimony already heard in the reduction in the sell  program, if Long Canyon and adjacent areas are included in the  wilderness, it is apparent that taxes on farm land will be raised,  which we sincerely deplore.  Therefore, I would suggest that the Selkirk Crestâ€”and the Selkirk Crest has been under a joint State Forest Service management  program since 1971. To date no complaints on management have  been received, and it appears this plan is working. Therefore, I  would suggest that the Selkirk Crest remain under the joint management plan and that the Long Canyon area be designated multiple use, and no further studies.     I&#39;ve made further observations from a recent tour of the area  that lead me to these conclusions: The white pine, cedar, and  spruce in Long Canyon are overmature and tops of white pine tress  are dying, and some spruce trees are completely dead. This area of  the creek has a deep, highly fertile soil. The highest and best use,  in my opinion, would be the production of trees. Good management  practices would result in opening up the heavy overhead canopy allowing the production of browse and young growth. The area is  almost sterile for game production as is true under this type of  canopy. Game at present is almost nonexistent. Forest management would greatly enhance the production of food for game, and  increase the numbers of birds and large and small animals.  Thank you. Senator.

Good morning, Senator. First of all, I would like to  say that I&#39;ve worked the last 11% years in sawmills, so I feel that  the economics presented to you were real scant today. I&#39;ll get to  that a little later.  About the fact about the wildlife in Long Canyon, I&#39;ve been in  Long Canyon many times and my feeling is that the sights and  fronts and the tracks I&#39;ve seen in Long Canyon contain all the representative wildlife that&#39;s found in the entire Selkirks, maybe  except for the caribou which I haven&#39;t found there yet.  Second, disease, as you know, is part of the forest, and when you  save an overgrown forest as wilderness, that&#39;s a part of it.  206  Buffer zones according to the Forest Service people, when you&#39;re  talking about buffer zones you have to manage a buffer zone as wilderness with specific management. The Forest Service says they  have no mandate to manage lands outside of the wilderness boundaries of buffer zones.  As far as some of the finances, I&#39;d like to just maybe get into the  school board a little bit, and I have complied figures from the last  10 years. I felt in that way it would show the cycle of how recession  works, and I feel that the reason that the money coming into the  county right now is also due because the timber industry is still  rising out of the current recession, and that&#39;s why the funds are  down. If you take the value of Long Canyon as 3 million board feet,  I&#39;ve estimated that it would costâ€”for the last 10 years would be approximately $7,400 per year, and that would come out to less than  a dollar a person in the county, and that&#39;s out of the budget, by the  way, of next year of $21V2 million.  And I&#39;d also like to say that I appreciate the fact that you are  here listening to us and that this is a free society, and we are able  to gather here for a give and take, and I hope that you will save  Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest as wilderness.

I&#39;m Terry Allen, and I&#39;m a housewife and mother  from Bonners Ferry, and my husband Joe Allen who is a chief  deputy for Boundary County could not make it today, but he did  submit testimony.  I&#39;m addressing the elimination of the caribou from north Idaho  due to possible logging operations, and the pristine old growth forests of North Idaho in the Long Canyon area is a prime year-round  habitat for the endangered caribou. The midaltitude cedar and  hemlock growth provide fall, early winter, and early spring mating  and feeding grounds, according to a Canadian study. In addition,  the higher altitude, subalpine, and spruce and fir stands provide  the essential life that the caribou need for their winter food supply.  And studies show that last year the caribou herds that roam south  of the Canadian border numbered a mere 20 animals. And this is  due to the various intrusions on their established range areas because of large scale logging operations, the adjoining access roads,  and the clearing for gas and power lines. And these all lend to the  destruction of traditional movement corridors from one range to  the next of the caribou, and destruction of valuable food sources,  and an influx of people, which could drive away these animals that  have been labeled by the U.S. Forest Service as a sensitive species.  And since then there have been reports of as many as 26 to 30 animals that exist in the Selkirk area, and I would like to be a part of  a society that recognizes these animals and provides them with a  habitat suitable for them.

I&#39;m from Boundary County. I moved here 4 years  ago from North Carolina. In that entire region, there are two small  designated wilderness areas: Shining Rock and Linville Gorge.  Those areas require a permit system for access. The reason is that  they are being loved to death. People from all over the eastern  United States come to see them. The demand for access to wilderness is so large and steadily increasing that the Forest Service was  forced to limit access. Permits are only necessary because of lack of  available wilderness in that part of the country.  In those areas the trails are ditches, the camping areas are bare  dirt, the rivers are filthy from upstream housing and agriculture.  In short, the wilderness character is being trampled to death.  The only solution, I believe, is to have more wilderness all across  the country to spread out the impact.  Long Canyon is uniquely different from the Selkirk Crest and is  the only area of its kind in Boundary County. I use it. I hike, hunt,  and fish there regularly. It is similar to Linville Gorge in that it  also has a remnant of the old-growth forest that used to cover  much of the United States.  Multiple use is a flawed concept in that it looks good on paper,  but in fact, multiple use is a very poor substitute for wilderness.     What it really means is that the logging industry gets their first  choice, and we, the public, get leftovers: tree stumps and brush. I,  for one, have seen plenty of tree stumps in Boundary County.  If you log Long Canyon, you&#39;ll get a 2-year lease on life for the  logging industry, then you&#39;ll be right back where you started.

I would like to briefly speak to the growing discussions on designations other than wilderness.  You have stated that you haven&#39;t received sufficient evidence on  why certain areas should be placed in the wildness system as of  now. The answer is simple. The areas being proposed for wilderness  by conservationists has high wilderness characteristics. However,  there is another reason why we believe that wilderness protection  is the only certain way these areas will be protected, and why no  lesser designation, particularly administrative, will do. The reason  is that this administration, in our opinion, more than anyone in  recent memory has changed the direction of Forest Service management. The administration&#39;s 1984 as well as 1983 budget request  by the Forest Service have made a mockery of sound and balanced  multiple use management. Once again, substantial increases were  requested for timber sales and road building, while other multiple  uses had been slashed. Based on administrative requests, the price  tag for fiscal 1984 timber program would be 900 million, including     appropriated funds and out-budget costs for roads. Much of these  funds would be used for below cost timber sales.  Given this kind of resource management philosophy, it is no  wonder why we are so concerned about the kind of designation an  area receives. We do not believe that any administrative protection  will be sufficient, and a congressional designation less than wilderness will be too easily overturned in the future.  Thank you.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator.  Members of the delegation, being born and raised in Boundary  County, I have had the opportunity to hike and explore the major  drainages that make up the Selkirks. I am an avid outdoorsman  and the quality of hunting, fishing, backpacking, and camping is  one of the primary reasons I live in this area.  Having hiked the entire length of Long Canyon recently and  having flown the area on several occasions, I will limit my talk in  regard to wildlife and recreation to Long Canyon.  During the hike through Long Canyon, one of my concerns was  the lack of wildlife and wildlife sign. This, of course, is due to the  lack of forage caused by he closed forest canopy which prohibits  sunlight from reaching the forest floor. Of course, we all know  wildlife needs security cover, but they also need forage to survive.  Opening up this forest cover would provide the necessary forage  that whitetail, and mule deer, elk, black bear, and moose require.  Certainly one of the big arguments is grizzly bear habitat and potential woodland caribou habitat. The more recent research results  are indicating grizzly preference for berries and rodents found in  clearcuts or around open areas caused by natural disturbances.     Other recent research could show that caribou prefer stands that  are more open than the closed forest cover found in Long Canyon.  In both cases a wilderness designation would prevent the prescribed burning or logging which would enhance wildelife habitat  so that this area would sustain a permanent population of many  different species.  In the other main drainages of the Selkirks that have been  roaded and logged there is an abundance of elk, deer, bear, moose,  and grouse. With minimum-impact roads and proper road closures  there is no doubt in my mind that Long Canyon has potential to be  a sportsmen&#39;s paradise.

And in Boy Scouts, they work on many more badges; such as,  birds, camping, edible wild plants, hiking, trees, backpacking, and  many more.  With its unique old growth forest, Long Canyon can be utilized to  earn any or all of these badges. Our youth can use Long Canyon to     compare with areas that have been logged. Here we can study the  difference between both kinds of areas. And our Scouts have used  Long Canyon to have fun. They&#39;ve seen things they can&#39;t see anywhere else and to earn their badges.  I think nature teaches us order and simplicity. And we can learn  a lot of things from nature. It&#39;s our own ignorance that causes tragedies that we have. Please don&#39;t let our youth suffer from our own  ignorance. We can stop most of these tragedies, I think, with  knowledge. Knowledge that we can obtain by keeping Long Canyon  as it is.  You know, Senator McClure, I had a Scout come up to me and  ask me &#39;Why should weâ€”why should you be taking all the trees  from Long Canyon when there are so many other trees around  here?&#39; I had no answer. I hope you do.  Thank you.",,RICHARD BECK,"BONNERS FERRY, IDAHO",Beck,Richard,h2d1,"beck, richard",Bonners Ferry (CITY); Long Canyon (LANDFORM),text

And that was the same year  that Christopher Columbus made a startling discovery that the  Earth was round. And it wasn&#39;t long after that that my eastern  brothers and sisters welcomed John Cabot to our North American  shores. And he claimed our land for the British Empire.  And when I was 121 years old, a ship called the Mayflower  landed. And we were introduced to settlers who brought customs  and ideas from clear across an ocean. And we, in turn, introduced  them to a world that was strange and beautiful and full of plentiful  resources in which to build an empire.     During my childhood, I heard wonderful tales of adventure and  discovery. And the one I like the best was the one about the revolutin in which we learned that the pioneers had taken the matter of  government into their own hands.  Well, today at 500 years old, I have seenâ€”I see much hardships  and economic strife. And I just want to emphasize that during my  lifetime through all the changes that I&#39;ve experienced, I&#39;ve never  lost sight of my responsibilities that I have in living in this area.

About 4 years ago, the Panhandle area council prepared a study  of the Boundary County economy. And they reported to the commissioners and the city council and the chamber of commerce. And  they told us that we were drastically overly dependent of the  timber industry. And they said that we have a lot of trees up there,  but the ecology doesn&#39;t raise trees that well. They grow trees a lot  faster over on the coast. And your long-term future is not in  timber.  I for one am not convinced that we have to log Long Canyon. I  think if we had wilderness status, it would enhance our ability to  attract recreation. I think that our future may be led more in  recreation than certainly in timber.  Long Canyon is obviously a controversial issue. It was politicized  some years back. There are wilderness terms that are used instantly now. It&#39;s pretty hard to come up with a clear, easy answer.  And in that case, I&#39;m inclined to reserve options until I&#39;m convinced that we need the timber. I&#39;m inclined to preserve it as it is  for its value as a recreation area.  I think that unless wilderness status is given Long Canyon now,  it sure ought to be logged, I think. And the only way to preserve  that option is to put it in wilderness now and beyond that later.","Thank you very much. I have no questions of the

Once violated, Long  Canyon will never be virgin again.  May I say, also, that putting all of our eggs in one basket or investing all of our capital toward one short-term end or putting  roads up all our American Selkirk drainages is neither good business, conservative, or wise.

Senator, my name is Frank Zimmerman. I&#39;m a  small contract logger in Bonners Ferry, Idaho. I also enjoy backpacking. My comments today are concerning Long Canyon.  A short time ago my wife and I took some avid backpackers on a  trip through Long Canyon. We had heard so much about the area  we wanted to see it for ourselves. It was beautiful, but so are all  forests, whether they are replanted clear-cuts or virgin stands. Because it is generally an old growth stand there was little evidence  of wildlife. There was a lot of blow-down, so hiking in Long Canyon  is generally limited to established trails.  Our friends had done extensive backpacking in central Idaho and  Washington. They were definitely not timber oriented, but they  could not understand why there was such a controversy over Long  Canyon. They, like us, felt that the only qualification Long Canyon  has for wilderness is that there are no roads. Alpine Lakes don&#39;t  abound, panoramic views are not accessible, and wildlife just isn&#39;t  very abundant. In short, Long Canyon just doesn&#39;t have any of the  qualifications that are generally associated with wilderness.  In contrast, only a 30-minute drive to the east takes one to the  Cabinet Mountains Wilderness. This 94,000 acre wilderness is one  of the most beautiful in our continental United States. With scores     of Alpine Lakes, rugged peaks, hanging valleys, and even a glacier  or two, this area fits the true definition of a wilderness area. Long  Canyon dos not fit this definition.  The people with us had done extensive backpacking but they  were not ready for such a physically demanding trail as is the trail  in Long Canyon.  Very few people are physically ready for a trek into Long  Canyon. I&#39;m sure this is one of the reasons that only a handful of  people go into the area.  I see no valid reason why an area this large should be locked up  as a private preserve for so few. Under a multiple use concept this  area could be used and enjoyed by many.  Thank you.",Thank you.

Senator McClure, there have been five generations  of Bakers in Boundary County. His grandfather arrived in the  early 1900&#39;s. And he has lived in the county 55 years. Various  members of his family have been in the past and present employed  in logging, mining, road building, and farming in the county.  He spend 6 years as county commissioner between the years of  1958 and 1964. In that time, he had the opportunity to sit in on  several occasions with the Forest Service and discuss their management plans. Since then he has seen drastic changes in those plans.  For example, steep slope areas had been clearcut causing erosion  with little regard to watershed and recommendations of their own  hydrologists. He believes the Selkirk Crest and Long Canyon fall  into the category of management.  He&#39;d also like to contrast the proposed management for Long  Canyon and Cow Creek, which is an adjacent drainage. Nature and  man have turned Cow Creek into a multiple-use area. Now the  Forest Service is proposing to lock up this area in an attempt to  turn it back into wilderness and will be spending considerable to do  so. On the other hand, they propose to tear up Long Canyon which     is currently natural. Senator McClure, where is the commonsense  behind this type of thinking?  What prompted him was an incident 3 weeks ago in which we  took his daughter and family camping. When we reached the top of  the ridgeâ€”a mountain ridgeâ€”his 6-year-old granddaughter pointed  out and said, &#39;What made those ugly scares?&#39; Later that day, his  daughter reflected back to the past 20 years to all of those campouts, hikes, and memories that all of his children hold dear. How,  then, he realized that the amount of changes those mountains had  gone through.  Four generations of Bakers have enjoyed the use of those mountains. He&#39;s concerned that the fifth will not know what the past  generations have. He prays that the big dollar does not decide the  issue. And that&#39;s it.",Thank you. Florence Carter.,MRS.

Thank you, Senator McClure. First, I would like to  thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Bob Crooks.  I&#39;m a physician in Bonners Ferry. I have been for 7 years. I&#39;m also  a member of the board of directors of the Bonners Ferry Chamber  of Commerce.  There are many reasons I chose to locate my practice in Bonners  Ferry. But paramount among them were north Idaho&#39;s exceptional  outdoor recreational opportunities and, more specifically, Boundary  County&#39;s exceptional back country. During the time I ve spent in  Bonners Ferry, I&#39;ve been involved in recruiting four additional physicians for our community. And I know it was what north Idaho  had to offer, not her booming economy, which allowed us to fill our  medical needs. There are many less fortunate parts of the country  where there are health care shortages.  I suspect that many physicians move to north Idaho for similar  reasons because they were attracted by the back country recreational opportunities available here. I&#39;ve included a copy of a letter  I wrote to all the physicians who have moved to Boundary, Bonner,  348  Kootenai, and Shoshone Counties in the past 10 years. Seventy-four  percent of the physicians responded to my survey. And of those, 92  percent said that back country recreational opportunities were significant factors in choosing north Idaho to establish their practice.  Furthermore, 94 percent said that they would like to see a wilderness area established in north Idaho. In the broader sense, I think  the message is that we need to preserve that which makes north  Idaho an attractive place to live guaranteeing that we will continue to be able to recruit people who can provide essential community services. The Selkirk Crest and Long Canyon, in my opinion, are  wilderness-quality areas. The addition of these areas to our National Wilderness System would not adversely impact our local economy or schools in a significant manner. The preservation of these  areas benefits our community in many ways including those I&#39;ve  mentioned. I urge you to invest in north Idaho&#39;s future, to preserve  her calling card, and include Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest in  your wilderness bill.  Thank you.",,DR. ROBERT W.

I would simply like to resuggest to you, Senator, that you in  your consideration for any wilderness proposal take a whole realm  of subjective values be presented by the different persons here  today in as great an importance as any empiric or economic considerations being aired here at the same time. You yourself, Senator, I  believe, have indicated in one of your recent issue of dates that one  of theâ€”or two of the primary guidelines for wilderness designation,  if I may quote, are &#39;lands designated as wilderness generally possess uncommon beauty and/or unique recreational value.&#39;  I would like to say the Long Canyon is an area of very uncommon beauty precisely because of the old growth timber within  there today. I don&#39;t know of any other drainage left in the northern panhandle which possesses such a wide sampling of old growth  systems. For beauty and recreational value, there is certainly no  comparison between the Long Canyon trail and any other roaded  drainage in this end of the State.  The older people within our community speak with a great deal  of pride about how it was when they first came here to a virgin  country to make a home and a living for themselves. And we  younger people tend to listen with a great deal of envy when they  talk about having to pack in 20 or more miles just to fish in the  high lakes.  I would like to say this, though, that we&#39;re preserved Long  Canyon as touchstone, if you will, not only for the intrinsic beauty  and wonder of the place itself but also for a very tangible sense of  continuity with the land and with the people to whom the land has  lent a part of its greadness.",,CHARLES McCRUM,"BONNERS FERRY, IDAHO",Mccrum,Charles,h2d1,"mccrum, charles",Boundary County (COUNTY); Long Canyon (LANDFORM),text

I&#39;m going to vary from my prepared statement. The prepared statement represents the position of  the Panhandle Snowmobile Club which is basically for multiple use  of the forest areas. And I&#39;d just like to say that as snowmobilers,  we&#39;re concerned with the very brutal possibility of losing some of  the most scenic and challenging area in our county to ride with the  wilderness designation. And the numbers of Spokane and Coeur  d'Alene snowmobilers who do travel to Boundary County to ride in  the Selkirks lend support to the value of the area for motorized  winter recreation.  As snowmobilers, we also have a vested interest in the Selkirks  in the form of a $125,000 parking and warmup facility funded by  Idaho snowmobile registration fees. This park located in the  Naples, Idaho, area is a jumping off point that focuses riding in the  southern portion of the Selkirk Crest.  I wanted to temper my remarks personally in that I was born  and raised in north Idaho. And the only time I left was to go to     college. And I determined I didn&#39;t want to walk around deserts for  the rest of my life as an economic geologist. I enjoy the forest and  streams of north Idaho. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m back. I&#39;d hate to lose  the quality of our forest lands. But I have trouble with the administration of the wilderness designation which will shut down areas  I love to visit via snowmobile.  The winter here is the only time my work allows me to recreate.  And the snowmobile is a means I utilize and enjoy the remoteness  of my Idaho.  I guess I&#39;m hoping for some way to have some middle ground on  the issue. Isn&#39;t there some way to preserve our forest quality and to  allow multiple forms of recreation?

I think that there is a limit to the area that we can  put in the category of having a mature crop which is deteriorating  and not being harvested and not contributing to the economic wellbeing of our country. This is very simply stated. But I think it is at  32-427 0â€”84 27  410  the heart of the issue.

Thank you, Senator McClure. Once again, I&#39;m  Tom Robinson representing the Wilderness Society. You won&#39;t  out     have to see me for at least 2 months now. I understand with- I understand at the Coeur d'Alene hearing that  someone suggested that the Wilderness Society purchase all the  roadless areas in Idaho. So I brought with me a blank check today  which I&#39;ll present to you.  The Chairman. How much are you offering?  Mr. Robinson. I would like to discuss some of the results of the  study our economic policy department did on the Clearwater Na-  tional Forest. And, in particular, the Bighorn/Weitas. And if you  don&#39;t already have a copy of this, I&#39;d be glad to present this.  We hear that these areas have been studied to death; but our  study shows otherwise. Although some existing stands of timber  may be profitable to harvest in the Clearwater, not enough infor-  mation exists on timber stands in the Bighorn Weitas or the Mal-  lard-Larkins to know whether there is much timber currently  there.  This study shows that reforesting and managing a treeless area  for future timber production is generally not economic. The Forest  Service will only recover costs if it is assured that existing stands  can bare the cost of present and future harvests.  Because of the uncertainty regarding existing timber volumes on  the Clearwater, the Forest Service may wish to delay harvest in  many of these areas until more is known about those volumes.  The contrast of results between existing stands and regenerated  stands raises a major policy decision for the Forest Service. That is,  whether a continuous sustained yield of timber is simply a biologi-  672  cal concept or whether it is alsoâ€”encompasses financial factors.  Once existing stands of timber are harvested, regenerated stands  may be biologically renewable. But their negative present net  values indicate that they are not economically renewable.  This study shows that delay in harvest on most of this area will  increase deterrents particularly when anything higher than a 4-  percent rate is used. It also suggests that only the most productive  areas should be logged. And these areas should be logged more in-  tensively.  If there is a reasonable likelihood that nontimber values in at  least some of the roadless areas outweigh the timber values there,  at least in the next few decades, then it is economically inefficient  for the Forest Service to rely on timber harvests from these areas  for those years.  The sustained yield concept applies to all renewable forest re-  sources. Not just timber. Application to timber alone without  taking into account the sustainability of other forest resources may  not provide the optimal mix of goods and services on the forest.  We hear that the industry needs certainty with respect to future  timber supplies. Well, we also would like some certainty with re-  spect to continual existence of elk and fish populations in the  Clearwater National Forest.  I just want to end with one quick point here. I&#39;ve heard that the  road credit provision, which was formerly part of the timber bail-     out bill, may still be alive particularly in the Senate. And I just  want to once again say that we oppose that particularly sinceâ€”  with respect to road credits, the industry would be receiving cred-  its. Even if it&#39;s more than the cost of the timber, those credits  would be applied to other forested regions. And I think that the  majority of testimony during the last 4 days should tell you about  how people in Idaho feel about itâ€”this issue. Thank you.","Want to bet?

I don&#39;t think this  country does need more timber. From what I understand, there is a  5-year backlog of timber sales waiting right now to be cut. So I  don&#39;t think thatâ€”timber is just an excuse for passing this. I don&#39;t  think it&#39;s a necessary economic boost for this area. In fact, it remined me of a science fiction story where I read once where people  were grappling for the last piece of land. And I think if we look at  the situation in truly long-term range, I think that timber as an  economic basis for Idaho is a dwindling hope. Every day we see  being developed construction and furniture and buildings. It&#39;s  going to end one day. And I think that Idaho should be looking for  a different economic face. And while I&#39;m not in economicâ€”I mean,  environmental purist, I don&#39;t like tourism any better. But of the  two, I think it&#39;s the least evil.  And I&#39;d like to see Idaho base its economy on tourism. Because of  the lower 48 States, we have more wilderness and more recreation  to offer than any other. And I think that&#39;s what is going to bring  us the money in the future.  And so I&#39;d just like to say I also support the soft release language. Thank you for letting me testify.","Thank you.

My name is Keith Tondrick. I live in Boise, Idaho. I would like to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to ex press my views concerning the disposition of roadless lands in the Boise, Challis, Payette National Forest. It is my feeling that a full public participation in the wilderness process is vital in developing a quality widerness bill. When  I  learned that you were planning to introduce a wilderness Excited, bacause I feel wilderness is an excellent objective and very good for the State of Idaho. But I was concerned about the haste in which the bill was seeming to develop. I was worried that perhaps certain pristine lands in the Boise National Forest may be overlooked as this bill was progressing. In that light I have been working with members of the envirnmental community to get out and inventory these lands and determine which acreage we would like to see in the wilderness bill. Approximately half the field season is remaining and we have not had an opportunity to inventory all the lands in the Boise and Challis and Payette National Forest. To this end we are still working on the process and plan to present to you our figures concerning the amount of wilderness we would like to see some time in October. I have led two trips into regions of the Boise National Forest that are roadless in order to get a firsthand view of these areas. One was 10 miles east, known as Sheep Creek along the Middle Fork of the Boise River road. The people I was with on this trip were awed by the beauty of these areas. We were up on a pass about 8,000 feet in the 10-mile east area looking north toward Idaho 21. We were really quite awed by the sight. It was almost like the coffee table picture book.  bill this year, I was excited and also very concerned.  But in essence the people said to me, &#39;This is a really pretty wil derness area and we really enjoyed the opportunity to get in here and hope to have the opportunity for our children to see this area also.&#39; I said to them, &#39;Well, that is correct. It is a real pretty wilder ness area. But it is not designated as wilderness.&#39; This concerned them. They were worried what it was going to look like 20 or 30 years from now. Could their children see the pris tine state that we saw it in. This was the concern of the people that I was leading. Could I make one other point? Yes, sir. Mr. Tondrick. I was in the Sawtooths two weekends ago and found on a Friday when I was traveling up to Trail Lake near Grandjean that there were about 15 people camping there. There was quite a large number of people. This shows to me the fact that wilderness is really something that is needed in Idaho. The wilder ness areas that are here are getting great use and the fact that the Sawtooths were so crowded, perhaps we should have the wilderness area closer to Boise so that we can dissipate the crowd and in that way I think it would improve the entire area.","The Chairman. Thank you very much.
Larry, you made reference, in your oral statement as well as in
your written statement, to hard release. As I indicated earlier, that
is a matter of concern to me, what we mean by the terms.
Mr. Blasing. My interpretation of the term &#39;hard release&#39; has
to do with essentially fixing a date that we can look at, at some
point in the future where the wilderness question is essentially re
solved.

My concern about soft release, as I interpret

tied to the national forest management

We talk about one generation of forest plans. That may be any
place from
years to 10 years to 50 years. Even though they are
designed for 10, the law isn&#39;t specific as to when those plans are to

wise, the Forest Service
not going to be able to get timber sales
or development projects into the planning screen and completed
prior to that length of time.
The Chairman. Well, isn&#39;t
a fact that future administrators of
forest lands will be free to make whatever recommendations they
wish to make about forest management?
Mr. Blasing. Absolutely.
The Chairman. And they can do that under the planning process
that
mandated by the other statutes under which they operate?
Mr. Blasing. Yes.
The Chairman. Under the development of a forest plan, they
identify areas within that forest that ought to be designated. Even
though a decision has been made with respect to wilderness, are
they not free to make a recommendation that that roadless area be
designated as wilderness?

Mr. Blasing. Certainly. And as I interpret the National Environ
mental Policy Act, that is one of the requirements.
The Chairman. So when you are talking about hard release, you
are not necessarily saying that they can&#39;t consider these lands for
future additions?
Mr. Blasing. No.
The Chairman. Is the issue then as I outlined to Gail Bray what
you have in your mind with respect to the difference between hard
release and soft release and that is the management directive
pending any decision?
Mr. Blasing. Yes.
The Chairman. If it is clear that the review which might be per
mitted or mandated by a statute for additions for study of roadless
areas of the future were to permit or direct, I should say, direct,
that the land be managed pursuant to the regular land manage
ment planning and management process until such a decision was
made, would you be so concerned about the difference between socalled hard and soft or the kind of release language that is writ
ten?
Mr. Blasing. No. Our concern is that we would like to have a
fixed point in the future where we know that this particular deci
sion does not need to be made over and over again and at that
point, certainly, it&#39;s going to be opened up again and the Forest
Service in their planning process has the option of doing whatever
they choose to do with those lands and even though they are not
considered precisely for wilderness, they can set it aside for other
purposes.

The Chairman. So your major concern is certainly for a period of
years?
Mr. Blasing. Yes.
The Chairman. Mr. Youngblood, do you have any questions
about that discussion?
Mr. Youngblood. No.
The Chairman. Do you share that feeling?
Mr. Youngblood. Yes.
The Chairman. Mr. Johnston?
Mr. Johnston. Yes.
The Chairman. Senator Symms?
Senator Symms. No questions, Mr. Chairman.

My intent is to briefly touch on one of the multiple uses of wil derness and that is watershed and specifically in the Boise forest although there are critical areas in other forests.  I am frustrated because I have much more testimony than is pos sible within a minute and a half. It is an immensely complex issue, but I will be very brief. Watershed involves the relationship between the water and the lands. Briefly, it is the drainage basin from which waters of streams are drawn. Normally the streams are fed by the percola tion of water released very slowly onto unsaturated soil. These forest soils have a high water storage capacity and that is where the water is held back and released gradually into the streams over the period of the season. Without this retentive quality, the upper reaches of the area is often dry or in drought condition later on in the season. But when water is released from forested land, it is gradual and reliable. Most importantly, it carries hardly any silt. The waters of a rapid runoff area carry sand, clay, and gravel, and affect stream quality and can be deposited farther downstream. Another consequence of rapid runoff would be a rise in the water level downstream. Forests provide permanent and self-perpetuating cover. Mainte nance of that cover is a guiding principle for its management where erosion threatens. The soils of the Idaho batholith are particularly fragile and sus ceptible to erosion when unprotected by the specifically adapted forest that covered that area.",,CAROL KRIZ,"BOISE, IDAHO",Kriz,Carol,h1d1,"kriz, carol",Boise (CITY),text

But I would like to depart from my written testimony. In my dental practice I treat many handicapped folks as well as elderly. Boise, Sawtooth, and Challis are the closest to our largest popula tion centers. In this population and smaller ones are physically and mentally handicapped citizens. One might first think that roads would be better for the handi capped. But really, the wilderness should be the same for everyone. The economic gains are the same for the elderly, the handicapped, and nonhandicapped populations. I believe it is important that we preserve roadless areas for their access. Whether deep penetration or just a hundred feet, this seg ment of population needs to be considered. Some may or may not need universities and museums. So it is with wilderness. These educational resources are required even though all do not use them. In Idaho we are lucky to have these resources to produce educa tion, recreation, and capital gain for all Idahoans. Americans and man and woman strength have always been their creativity. Living in concert with the land and changing our life style to the better is our challenge.

My name is Charles Roth and I have come here today to tell you why I moved to the great State of Iowa. I was born and raised in a small industrial community in the  cement belt of eastern Pennsylvania. I have witnessed what the in sidious encroachment of man has done to the forest, air, water, and wildlife of Pennsylvania. I began an intensive study of the Rocky Mountain States in an effort to determine what States contain the most unspoiled acreage and found Idaho suited that description. Its vast expansion of the national forests and roadless wilderness abounds with a wide variety of wildlife, scenic beauty, and quality of life found in few other places in the lower 48 States. In contrast, Pennsylvania with slightly over 1 million acres of national forest land and absolutely no wilderness areas, leaves wildlife species little room for propagation. Wildlife is forced to coexist with man or face extinction as wit nessed by the black bear whose numbers have diminished so drasti cally that the day is not too far distant when hunting black bear will be prohibited so that it will not follow the eastern elk or the woods bison into extinction. I therefore urge Senator McClure to include in his bill, in your legislation, the entire endangered wildlife wilderness core. I further urge the Senator that at least 40 percent of the 6.5 mil lion acres of roadless forestland be protected in your bill and that the bill be considered completely on its own and not in connection with any other bill affecting any other State or cause.

Mr. Chairman, I&#39;m a native Idahoan, born and raised in Weiser and grew up camping, hunting, fishing, and hiking in Idaho&#39;s mountains. There is no person that will testify here today that has a greater love and respect for Idaho and her glorious mountains, rivers, lakes and streams, and fish and wildlife than I do. But I firmly believe that the management of Idaho&#39;s national forest lands for the optimum utilization of all of the natural re sources contained thereon is compatible with the long-term integri ty of the State&#39;s natural beauty and abundant fish and wildlife. In fact, proper management can enhance all of these resources. But wilderness classification precludes management and deprives the majority of the citizens of the benefits of these resources. Wil derness is antipeople and contrary to the principle of equal oppor tunity for all people that this country was founded on. I would like to briefly relate a story that exemplifies how the av erage citizen is being forced off the public lands. A number of years ago my wife and I decided to go camping at Stanley Basin, which is just north of the Sawtooth National Wil derness area. The campgrounds around the lake were completely full. But that didn&#39;t matter, since we didn&#39;t like camping in developed camp grounds anyway. We followed a road up the creek that emptied into the west end of the lake and found a beautiful place to camp a few hundred yards from the lake. A sign by the road said that it was 7 miles up the road to a wil derness trailhead. We set up our tent camp alongside the road just a few hundred yards from one of the most heavily used recreation al areas in the State and spent a glorious weekend completely by ourselves. The next year we packed all our gear on our old orange pickup and headed back for the same spot. But when we got to Stanley Lake, we found that the Forest Service had built a barricade across the road that went back up the creek and a big sign said no motor ized vehicles beyond this point. We had to go camping elsewhere.",,JOHN L. HATCH,"BOISE, IDAHO",Hatch,John L.,h1d1,"hatch, john l.",Boise (CITY); Weiser (CITY); Stanley Basin (LAKE); Stanley Lake (LAKE),text

I think it is not true for several reasons: because of research values, because grazing is allowed, and because of the recreation, and because it avoids tax subsidies in relation to log ging. Relating to research, mycorrhizal fungi is not exactly a house hold word but because microorganisms helps plants to grow faster and healthier, it may be one of the agricultural boom industries of the future. Undisturbed wilderness holds the key to understanding how fungi and higher plants work together. Because man&#39;s activities may eliminate the beneficial microbes, the wilderness is essential.  121  For example, lack of bacteria may be the cause of failure of pine trees to reseed in clearcuts in parts of our national forests. Another example, cedar has a very complex mycorrhizal associa tion and trees that are 100 years old have different fungis than young trees or trees over 500 years. If we eliminate the old growth, such as Long Canyon, we may  eliminate the beneficial fungi.

Conservation groups and concerned citizens have spent this past  summer diligently working at collecting current information on roadless areas to determine their wilderness and nonwilderness values. The research these groups are doing entail looking into the eco nomics, wildlife characteristics, mining activities, logging potential, watershed quality, grazing activities, and recreational uses in this area in hopes of coming up with a concise idea of how these areas should be classified.

Senator, I am Glenn Selander, a resident of Boise,  Idaho.     144  I testify as an individual with a personal concern that we not overstep the line marking the balance between our presence in nature and the presence of that which is not us. As a person, I know it is important to maintain a balance in my physiological structure to remain healthy. Biologists indicate the steady state of our cellular structure is required for us to be healthy. It stands to reason this model is true for our presence in nature. Others may speak of the economic issues of resources and jobs, of deficit timber sales, of timber and wilderness conflict, but I speak from the experience of being allowed only half the trout in posses sion I once was allowed, of seeing more and more denuded slopes in the Boise and Payette Forests, of seeing more and more silted river and creekbeds in the roaded areas of these same forests and of seeing more and more people in both the roaded and roadless areas of southern and southwest Idaho. From this point of view, personal appreciation for and concern for the health of the wild areas, I know we must designate more roadless areas to protect the wild environment from the swelling encroachment of humans. Our raids on the forests and rivers with our machinery are a geo metrically increasing burden on a nature designed only to be able to compensate for our presence on foot. Second, as a city councilman of the largest metropolitan area in Idaho â€” not speaking for the council but as one experienced in deal ing weekly with the concerns of developers and employers who wish us to make growth and development possible, I know that one of the prime considerations of those being wooed to come here is the availability of a healthy natural environment. Potential residents continually ask questions about the availabil ity of their favorite outdoor pastimes. And those pastimes include access to roadless and healthy, and thus health-giving to them, for ests and rivers. Such amenities are necessary to the health, wellbeing, and productivity of urban dwellers and, therefore, of their corporate and Government employers.

One technical study that I have read used an economic analysis to de termine what is the long-term investment potential in national Forest Service land. And you can compare the situation to a farmer planting and tending this crop for 80 years before he gets his first cut. And given the conditions of tree farming, it really does not pay the forest industry to invest their money there. They would be better off than the bank. They would be better off putting it in the bank. They would get less than 4 percent because of the high cost of the land.

I feel that I alone of those in this room, and probably this entire State, have been in all the areas, all the wild areas, that are being considered today, with the exception of Mount Naomi, and I&#39;m going there soon.  I have seen something that very few other people have had the privilege to see in the United States, the incredible physiographic and biological diversity of the State of Idaho. Our unusual bound aries have combined to give us a great array of ecosystems of any State in the union and perhaps greater. But ecosystems have been destroyed. And in this State, and even in our time they have been destroyed. We have lost the salmon in a great number of our rivers. We will lose the last caribou, the last grizzlies, the last wolves, the last lynx. All these are dependent on the wilderness and on wildlands. I want to see examples of Idaho&#39;s incredible wildlands preserved for the future. I want Idaho to retain the full range of plant and animal species. I don&#39;t want to see these wild animals I mentioned sacrificed for short-term gains, for subsidized and inefficient indus tries. I think a lot of what I want could be achieved in a multiple use framework with some sort of wilderness, recreation, wildlife man agement.  But in this administration, we have seen that multiple use can be quickly destroyed by narrow economic interests that has little respect for the law and no regard for balanced land use manage ment.  With that said, I am sure you will remember the first time talked to you, I spoke about multiple use, not wilderness.",,SHELDON BLUESTEIN,"BOISE, IDAHO",Bluestein,Sheldon,h1d1,"bluestein, sheldon",Mount Naomi (LANDFORM); the United States (COUNTRY); Idaho (STATE),text

As a fifth-generation westerner, I have some knowledge of the extent to which the public domain has been exploited for private profits. If our wildlands were limitless, such exploitation could continue indefinitely. But our wilderness is limited. And we must recognize those limits if we want to retain our national character.

My name is Alfred McGlinsky and I live at 1500  Chase Street in Boise. We moved to Idaho 21 years ago and we own, with a family of friends, 400 acres of Teton County. I don&#39;t know whether we are talking about that today, but I must because I came from Idaho Falls. There we shared a fence a mile and half long with the Targee National Forest at the northern end of the Garns Moutain roadless     area.  It is interesting to note that this area is so remote and the tree growth rate so slight that it was never logged. Yet on June 28 the Forest Service offered the trees on the adjoin ing land for sale in a package called Grandview 2. They have scheduled to follow this January the Granview 1 sale. And the Kirkham Hollow sale with be in February next year. All the specified roads in this now roadless area are to be built with appropriated funds, courtesy of the rest of us taxpayers. I am opposed to such practices and I think it is especially hypo critical in this State whose national and State legislators are so quick and frequent in championing the free enterprise system. Even more importantly, though, I believe it is presumptuous to rush a once and for all decision on a matter so complex as the dis position of Idaho&#39;s remaining wilderness. There is no need to rush and there is danger in so doing since hastily conceived plans could not possibly digest and value all parts of the wilderness equation. I also believe that it is presumptuous to decide quickly how much of Idaho&#39;s wilderness to eradicate because to decide now, once and for all, would be to presume that we have the wisdom to speak ac curately on how future generations will need and value wilderness. Without question, Idaho&#39;s population, like that of the Northwest, the country, and the world, will double or perhaps triple, even before my own grandchildren die. That is an inescapable fact which I dislike intensely but it is one which convinces me of the folly of our thinking we could or should decide, even through such seemingly rational processes as this, what the future should be. How can we know what their resources and land use needs and preferences will be. For that reason, I am especially opposed to what we have come to call hard-release language. I much prefer the courtesy of letting future peoples determine what is in their own best interest. It follows naturally, then, that I believe that we should preserve all the existing wilderness areas that we possibly can as a cushion for the needs of a burgeoning population. And finally, should you ignore my concern about haste and go on to draft an Idaho wilderness bill, please be certain to protect at least one-half of the remaining 6.5 billion acres of national forest wilderness areas and to include all of the 10 areas in what has been called the endangered Idaho wilderness core.

A couple of years ago a fellow with the Sawtooth Forest told me that almost every timber sale on the Sawtooth was a money-losing proposition for the Forest Service. Thus, it appears to me that the fiscally responsible option is to go for wilderness rather than loging. Most of the Idaho batholith is poor for growing timber. It makes about as much sense to try to grow trees in the mountains as to grow potatoes there. The big trees there now are the result of hundreds of years of natural forces at work. The Forest Services figures about 120 years for a 20-inch tree in the Boise Forest, that that assumes active silvaculture in terms of planting and caring for the trees, and the natural forests have not received much funding for that. The 120-year estimate is quite optimistic under current practices. Compare the productivity here with that in the Southeastern United States where timber companies are buying â€” land like my grandfather&#39;s from which he could harvest trees every 20 years off flat land that was not damaged by roads. Marvel at areas in New Zealand where a 20-inch Monterey pine takes only 20 years to grow and where douglas fir has to be crowd ed to slow growth enough that the trees harvested will yield lumber suitable for construction.

I would just like to read my prepared statement.  I feel that wilderness is Idaho&#39;s drawing card. If population growth continues in this area, more and more Idaho residents will be looking for pristine mountain areas, undisturbed trout streams, and big game animals that require graze land unpressured by human progress. My wife and I are Idaho residents by choice. We investigated many different areas of the country before choosing Idaho as home. Idaho offers the quality of life that is rapidly disappearing in this world. Recreational opportunities offered by the wilderness area are a treasure to Idahoans. Revenues generated by tourism and travel rank second only to agriculture in the State. To me this can be attributed directly to the roadless areas which provide quality fishing, hunting, camping, sightseeing. Perhaps wilderness&#39;s greatest value is solitude. Even a novice Idaho fisherman, such as myself, can see that the streams in the wilderness areas provide a much better quality fish ery than the sediment filled watersheds in proximity to the logging roads.  The practicalities of this issue support maximum wilderness des ignation. Logging cannot be profitable in some of these areas with out Federal subsidies. I would like to go on record as supporting national wilderness designation for Boise and Payette National Forest areas. I also support the Endangered Core and soft release.

Ms. Senator and gentlemen, under the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act of 1980, there is a mandate to promptly develop and adopt a program to protect, miti gate, and enhance fish and wildlife, including related spawning grounds and habitat on the Columbia River and its tributaries. The act further directs that the program to the greatest extent possible shall be designed to deal with that river and its tributaries     as a system.  Unfortunately, this act is limited to the development and oper ation of mitigation of hydroprojects. This flaw in the bill may very well abort the major effort and the expenditure in time and money that is now being made by the Northwest Power Planning Council in their efforts to restore the anadromous fish runs to their former abundant state. Historically, the South Fork of the Salmon River supported one of Idaho&#39;s largest Chinook Salmon runs, as well as a large run of steelhead trout. Unfortunately, this veritable treasure was located in one of the most highly erodible areas in the State. Before 1950 there were few problems. But by 1965 when timber harvesting was begun on higher slopes and 622 miles of roads had been constructed, largely for timber sales, a catastrophe occured. Arnold and Ludeen estimated that by 1967 accelerated soil ero sion in the watershed above the Cache River had increased sedi ment loads in the river by 350 percent compared to conditions before 1950. This sediment buried Chinook salmon and steelhead trout redds under thick blankets of sand, smothering the fry as they emerged from the egg, and reducing the runs of the salmon and steelhead to a pitiful remnant of their former state. A moratorium on logging and road construction was then imple mented and the streams are recovering. But the Forest Service is going back into this area to very carefully log, they say. The cumulative impact potential for the anadromous fish in this area is disheartening. And if you will read the testimony, you will find my areas of concern.",,MARJORIE G.

The permanent allocation of national assets of this dimension should not be subject to such arbitrary distinctions as manmade lines defining States and land areas. The expectations, needs, and demands of the people of this Nation can in the future only be met through a national concept. I believe the basic question today concerning wildlands in this Nation from as well as Idaho, is: Have we already gone too far? Can the Nation in the future meet the demands of its people for wild and unspoiled lands. Are we doing socially what we have al ready done economically: piling up huge debts for our children who will need these wildlands and the amenities much more than we do.  It seems to me we are actually borrowing from our children by not, with every means at our command, reserving and protecting for the future a large percentage of our existing wildlands.

I am appearing before you today to express my concern that no more wilderness legislation be considered, that the mass confusion in the status of designated nonwilderness lands be solved, and the hope that legislation for Idaho will address the cur rent problem of de facto wilderness management by land manage ment agencies and prohibit this practice. To cite a specific instance, in addition to the present limbo status of RARE II lands, the management of designated multiple use lands for enhancement of the gray wolf. Just this last week I witnessed, along with approximately 25 other resource leaders in the State, U.S. Forest Service rangers pointing out roads in multiple use areas that had been closed for the specific purpose of creating a prey base for the gray wolf. We really thought you had expressed a legislative solution of des ignating the gray wolf to management in the wilderness areas     288  only. Somehow the agencies are not listening, further adding to the confusion. Finally, I would like to express my keen disappointment in what appears to be a clear departure of some of our leaders from the age old concept of the value of private ownership. In a very peaceful way, thousands of Idahoans expressed their concerns that BLM lands be passed to private ownership in order to increase productivity and add much needed support to a sadly depressed State tax base. It was then disappointing to read that those same thousands of Idahoans were told they ought to be like Nixon in Vietnam, declare victory and withdraw. Stunned as we were by this tragic comparison, we felt, nonethe less, that perhaps our leaders in Washington had a solution they did not care to share with the residents of their home State. Further discouragement came in the last 30 days with statements suggesting disbanding the property review board, and in the minds of our citizens, bringing a halt to the meager land sale program that was in existence. I challenge the Senate committee that abandoning the concept of private ownership and embracing more wilderness is no soluton at all. I respectfully submit this testimony.

I hold a degree in range and forest management from the University of Idaho. My business and public service expe rience has been resource oriented. From this training and experi ence, I propose very limited additions to the wilderness system and a firm rededication to mulitple use management of Idaho public lands.  I will elaborate and document my concerns in written testimony. For now, I would summarize that it is my firm conviction that any special use or dominant use designations will only serve to appease the benefited few and penalize a far greater number of Idaho citi zens and the Nation.  In general, I firmly believe in responsible multiple use manage ment of our public lands. We do not need logging sanctuaries, energy parks, motorbike reservations, or left-handed fly fisherman     ponds.  We need policies, law, and administration capable of amalgamat ing all of those special interests, in combination with the one pre dominant value of any Idaho wildland â€” that of watershed protec tion. I therefore urge the Senate committee to emphasize the responsi ble multiple use management of Idaho forests. Additions to the ex isting extensive wilderness system should be limited to: One, ad ministrative boundary adjustment; Two, legitimate limited carefully selected ecosystems which are not yet represented in that system. The act of duplicating, triplicating, and quadruplicating an iso lated area inventory would be a serious disservice to our State. There are multiple use opportunities in the most remote corners of Idaho. For example, the universal watershed needs which could be ruined by natural fire wilderness philosophy, recreation for large numbers of people, roadless recreation, hydro energy and grazing, without ever mentioning the usual whipping boys of logging and mineral exploration. The challenge and the opportunity is multiple use success and multiple use discipline, not special use privilege. Thank you.","Has Mr. Hallstrom arrived?

Senator McClure, my great-grandfather was a pio neer in eastern Idaho. My grandmother and my mother were both born and raised in Idaho.  293     I was not born and raised here, but I chose to come here and raise my family here because of the love of Idaho my family did teach to me. When I came to live here in Idaho, I knew I would not be living in a wilderness. I knew I would be living in a city, work in the city, pay taxes, buy my goods at stores, and hopefully contribute to the society there. I knew that when I needed to get away from the city, as we all do, I could very easily, as those lucky ones that live here in Idaho. An example in my case is the Payette Crest area, which is fairly close to Boise, and I have included a little more information about my thoughts on the Payette Crest in my prepared testimony. I would simply like to say that I think my great-grandfather would join with me in urging you to please keep the choices, the wilderness choices, for my great-grandchildren, as they are here for me today.

For the hearing record I would like to state that I am a strong supporter of wilderness    areas.  Also, I would like it known that I support the Idaho endangered wilderness core. At this time I don&#39;t believe the areas in question have been fully researched and surveyed enough. So for this time I would like to say that the usage of this land in the long-term decision should not be made.  The areas that I wanted to talk about are covered in my written testimony. I also want you to know that I will be supporting the conserva tionist&#39;s alternative which will be presented in October 1983. I moved to Idaho approximately 3 or 4 years ago from a State that did not have any access to wilderness areas. And my family and I have found that we definitely enjoy the quality of life that we have found here in Idaho and we enjoy the solitude and beauty that we see here and I would definitely hate to see the things happen in Idaho that I saw happen in the other States I was from. And I thank you for letting me express my opinions.",,KIM CANTWELL-GAB,"BOISE, IDAHO",Cantwell-gab,Kim,h1d1,"cantwell-gab, kim",Boise (CITY),text

Thank you. Idaho is blessed with a wealth of re  I believe we need to use these resources for the longterm economic growth of the State. That&#39;s why I support the pres ervation of the 10 endangered core areas of the wilderness. On a recent trip that I took to British Columbia, the tour guide pointed out some paintings on the ceiling of the capitol dome indi sources, and     309  eating the four industries of the province at the turn of the centu ry. And since the time of the painting, though, tourism had grown from insignificant to become the second largest industry. Times change and we have to adjust our views of the world ac cordingly. We&#39;ve seen the national economy move from a manufacturing base to a high-tech service base, and we will also see Idaho become less and less dependent upon the traditional industries that built the State. The State economy will follow the national trend to high-tech service industry, including the tourism service industries. But our growth rate will depend primarily on whether we choose to follow the national trend or lead that trend. Idaho has over 10 million acres of roadless area. The recreation value of this land is a salable resource that can produce long term economic returns for the State far into the future. Most Americans and many foreigners have a very romantic view of the American West. I&#39;ve seen Japanese tour groups on horseback and Sawtooth Wilderness camping there. There is an Idaho outfit ter that takes wealthy French businessmen into Idaho back coun try on hunting trips. People will pay to see Idaho if they know what&#39;s here and if we preserve it for them to see. Many people have no idea where Idaho is, in the first place. In the Boise, Payette, Sawtooth and Challis National Forests, I support wilderness designation for the White Clouds, Boulder Mountains conservationist proposal there, French Creek, Lick Creek, The Needles, North Lemhis, Smoky Mountains, Cache Peak, Pioneers, and Borah Peak. Mining should be prohibited in the White Clouds. Anyone who has been in the White Cloud Mountains knows that they are a very special place. Tax dollars should not subsidize road logging construction. And I should also mention that I do not support hard release.",,SHELDON D.

I&#39;m from here in Boise. I moved to Idaho a number of years ago because Idaho offered a quality of life which was unique in our Nation. The slow pace of life combined with clear, clean skies, majestic mountains and spar kling waters are truly something special for me, and I think for ev eryone else in this room. These values justify for me an extraordi nary effort to protect the Idaho that I have come to know and love. The many thousands of acres of wilderness in our State are one of the special values that brought me here. I have been able to ex plore a portion of the wilderness, but the constraints of time im posed by earning a living have left me with a list of further areas to explore. I sincerely hope that these areas are still wild and pris tine when I am finally able to complete their exploration. In my written testimony I have addressed a number of reasons for wilderness classification, and I would like to discuss just one of them now in the interest of redundancy. And that&#39;s an economical ly conservative generation. A distressingly large number of deficit timber sales occur in our national forests here in Idaho. I don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s responsible economic or resource management to sell our Nation&#39;s timber when the costs of development exceed the value of that timber. This is particularly hard to understand when the result is the deterioration of other economically valuable resources. Studies by the Natural Resources Defense Council have shown that in many of Idaho&#39;s national forests for every dollar spent on timber sales there is only a 24 to 26 cent return. The timber indus try would have us believe that we cannot afford to place these lands in wilderness protection. With such a dismal record, I believe that we cannot afford not to. Our President has wisely set the goal of reducing the Federal budget deficit and eliminating waste in our Government. National forest timber sales in Idaho would be a darned good place to start. It&#39;s bad enough to lose our movement of heritage, our soil and water quality, and our wildlife resources, but not even our coverage of doing so is insulting. I support the endangered Idaho wilderness core proposal. The lands in this proposal are essential for a good wilderness system in Idaho. Thank you very much.",,WINSTON E.

Agriculture is Idaho&#39;s No. 1 indus try; tourism is Idaho&#39;s No. 2 industry. Protection and conservation of Idaho&#39;s wilderness areas will pro tect critical watershed for the agricultural industry and will pro mote the tourism industry. Timber harvesting promotes soil ero sion and historic watershed. It also decreases tourism because who wants to look at bare mountains. Furthermore, I don&#39;t believe that taxpayers should be subsidizing the tourism industry by paying the cost of building logging roads and administering the national forests. Idaho&#39;s current designated wilderness areas are too small for the vast numbers of people visiting them. Campsites and many trails in the Sawtooth Wilderness Area are already being closed because of overuse.  For the agricultural and tourism industries, you must save our wilderness areas. We don&#39;t need to create them; they&#39;re already there. I support the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core and hope all Idaho&#39;s wilderness will remain wilderness. Thank you.",,KATHRYN H.

I love the outdoors, and I do not want to see the forests cut down because it will destroy the animals&#39; homes and the deer, elk, bears, cougars, and other animals will disappear. Fish will also be killed because of landslides into the rivers caused by     cutting down the trees and building new roads. We need more of our wilderness areas to be protected because our current designated wilderness areas are overused and have too many people trying to escape the busy cities at the same time and in the same place. I want all the roadless areas to remain wilderness the way they are now so that when I grow up I can take my children to see our native land the way it all used to be.","Thank you very much.

Thank you, Senator McClure. The roadless areas close to Boise and McCall must be considered  for wilderness classification. They are the places we people of southwestern Idaho can visit in a day or on a weekend and come away refreshed from experiencing a special wild place. Let&#39;s leave them as they are. A good road system is already in place to give automobile access to within a few miles of scores of lakes, streams, and mountain peaks. Trail systems exist and need little improvement. The area I am most familiar with is referred to as the Payette Crest in the endangered Idaho wilderness core presented by the conservation groups. I started hiking in Oregon, where I grew up, in the late 1950&#39;s. Since then, I have hiked in many of the mountainous areas of the West as well as in New England and in the Swiss Alps. These wild areas around McCall compare favorably in terms of ruggedness, solitude and the special beauty of an alpine setting. It is rare to be able to experience such isolated and spectacular areas with so little effort as we can in the Payette Crest. Idahoans, now and in the future, need to have special areas like the Payette Crest saved as they are now. The only way this can be done is through their formal designation as wilderness. Finally, I would like to support the 10 endangered Idaho wilder ness core areas as proposed by the conservation groups. I support their attempts to determine possible wilderness boundaries for these areas and for others such as Steel Mountain, the Trinities, Breadwinner, Snowbank Mountain, Rapid River and Council Moun tain. The most important additions to Idaho wilderness would prob ably add another 3 million acres to the existing 3.8 million. Please wait until October when the conservationists and sports men have their wilderness proposal together before putting your legislation into final form. Also, I oppose hard release language for any of the roadless areas not designated as wilderness in the forthcoming legislation.  Thank you.",,JOHN W.

My name is David Gab. I would like to go on â€” oh, excuse me. Hello, Senator McClure. My name is David Gab. I would like to     go on record supporting Idaho&#39;s endangered wilderness core. This includes the areas known as Long Canyon, Selkirk Crest, Mallard, Larkins, et cetera. However, I am not limiting my support to that proposal. I firmly believe that the RARE I and II processes failed to provide adequate  information concerning fish, wildlife and their habitat. For this reason, I find your desire to settle Idaho&#39;s wilderness question once and for all rather hasty and very alarming. This is not an issue that can be solved simply or rapidly. Allowing private interests including timber, mining, off-road vehicles, et cetera, to enter these areas prematurely may destroy critical habitat neces sary to sustain current populations of fish and wildlife, the irony in this is that we may be permitting this destruction without even knowing what is there. I am not advocating that all roadless areas immediately be desig nated as wilderness areas, but rather that any final decision be de layed until adequate evaluations can be conducted. On these grounds, I oppose any sort of hard release language that would eliminate the possibility of any future wilderness designations. Thank you for allowing me to express my concern. And I hope you understand the full impact of your decision when you develop your proposal.  Thank you.","Thank you very much.

Thank you, Senator McClure. I am Bruce Bowler, 1111 Shaw Mountain Road, Boise, Idhao. The Kelly Creek drainage in the Clearwater National Forest should definitely be classified wilderness because of the special westslope cutthroat fishery and the important need for watershed quality control for wildlife indigenous to the area. These values far exceed those of timber harvest. The White Clouds and North Lemhis in the Challis National Forest should also have wilderness protection because they have special natural qualities that need good Federal stewardship to ad minister the public trust for the use and benefit of future genera tions unspoiled by logging and mining. The Payette Crest has wilderness qualities that needs classifica tion to protect its vital watershed, particularly for steelhead and salmon fisheries including the South Fork of the Salmon River. Steel Mountain and the Trinities in the Boise National Forest should not be left out of Idaho wilderness as having quality habi tats for wildlife and watershed protection for our irrigation systems which are irreparably damaged by logging.     329  I have personal familiarity with all of these areas along with others too numerous to mention within the time restraints but which deserve consideration for wilderness classification. Rush to judgment now for hard release of nonclassified wilder ness, foreclosing future options is a wrong concept. Why should this generation assume paramount wisdon? There are many children and grandchildren that should have some options left for them to decide about opportunities for wilderness retentions. The small amount of Idaho yet available for wilderness with 6V2 million acres now roadless is only 12.3 percent of Idaho&#39;s 52,989,000 acres and should prompt caution for hard release. They are not making any more of the wilderness that gives Idaho much of its unique quality of life, making our State the best place to live. De struction of original wilderness is forever. We should not be beholden to barons of traditional forest prod ucts industries to now foreclose future options for wilderness and give them subsidies in roading wilderness-type public lands which should be held in reserve. The economy produced from outdoor recreation is just as good as the depleting economy from timber and mining. Thank you, Senator McClure.","Thank you.

I&#39;m not used to doing this, but will do it anyway be cause I care about Idaho. I am Stacie Groll and have lived in Idaho  for 11 years. I am very proud to be an Idahoan because Idaho has the second largest amount of wilderness in all the 50 States, second only to Alaska. I would very much like to keep it that way. I strongly support the preservation of all 6.5 million acres but espe cially support the 10 endangered Idaho wilderness core. Several places I&#39;ve actually been to are the Sawtooth completion, Snowbank Mountain, and the area near Silver Creek Plunge which is part of the Scott Mountain proposal. They are all very beautiful and have excellent wildlife, fishing and recreation, and watersheds. In north Idaho the wildlife habitat is more important In south Idaho the stability of the watersheds becomes increasingly impor tant. I just had a very nice camping trip at Silver Creek Plunge this weekend. I camped, hiked, picked a couple handfuls of huckleber ries, and went swimming. It was very beautiful up there, and we even saw some deer. I also support soft release so that we can keep forest manage ment options open in future planning cycles. Wilderness is multiple use. We can use it for four out of five uses: Range, recreation, wildlife, and watershed. The only use not included is timber. Also, there is comparatively little commercial timber in these 6.5 million acres. If an area is deserving of wilderness, it should be des ignated as wilderness.  32-426  0â€”84  22  330     Tourism is the second biggest industry and is growing fast. Tour ism is a more renewable use of steep and unstable or otherwise fragile areas then logging. In the early years people used to take fresh air, fresh water, beauty, and wildlife for granted. They thought the endless prairies, mountains, and rivers would never disappear or that there was so much there that it wouldn&#39;t be ruined. I, for one, would like to save these last 6 million acres as they are, and I hope that any child and the grandchildren that I may have can enjoy this, too. Even the areas I can&#39;t visit I feel good about knowing they are preserved.

Thank you, Senator McClure, for having these hearings here in Idaho for all of us to  express our views on this very important decision that&#39;s going to be made by you and other Members of the Senate and the House of  Representatives. I want to say that I support the endangered Idaho wilderness core and will support the conservation sportsmen proposal that will be introduced in October. I&#39;m especially concerned about the Sawtooth completion, the Payette Crest, and the White Clouds. And as far as White Clouds is concerned, I understand you may consider that separately, but if you consider it as part of this bill, I would encourage that you have a no-mining provision in that bill. I&#39;m particularly interested in the wilderness areas close to Boise, Rapid River, Steel Mountain, Red Mountains, and others, but I won&#39;t go into those until the conservationist proposal is more de tailed. I would ask, too, that, whatever wilderness bill you come up with, the remaining areas as much as possible â€” if not all â€” could be     333  soft release. However, the tenor of my testimony that I would like to concentrate on is that the increasing Idaho&#39;s â€” building Idaho&#39;s economy on tourism and the wilderness aspects of it is something that really makes a lot of sense. Due to high interest rates and other factors, as you probably know, the mining industry is at an all-time low in the State of Idaho, where in 1980 it was 1.4 percent of the Idaho jobs. It only predicted to be 1.1 in 1987. And due to the volatile aspect of that industry, it&#39;s not expected to increase much. Likewise, the timber industry, another important part of the Idaho economy, will never probably see the days it did in the 1970&#39;s due to the fact that people are now demanding marked interest rates for their money. The lenders, as it were, are the savers and, therefore, the whole timber industry is going to change its color. You are going to find more multiple-family housing, much more smaller housing, getting away from detached family homes. But let me say â€”quote a few statistics about tourism in Idaho. Tourism in Idaho is a $1 billion industry with 29,000 employees, 8 percent of Idaho&#39;s employment, $166 million payroll, $32 million in taxes, and 4 million visitors. Specifically, 40 â€” excuse me. In 1981, 54,000 people used Idaho outfitters and guides; 90 per cent of out-of-State game hunters spent some time in the wilder ness.  According to the statistics from the Travel Industry Council in Washington, D.C., in the West, when vacationing, the following rec reational activities were incorporated: 58 percent for hiking; 40 per cent, swimming; 33 percent, fishing; 11 percent, backpacking; 9 per cent, golf and tennis.

My name is Tim Peterson. I live in Boise. The wilderness areas being discussed are not just rock, water, plants, and animals. They are the very heart of Idaho. They are one of the prime reasons the native Idahonans stay, and one of the  prime reasons that young, well-educated, productive people move to Idaho. Our State&#39;s future may well be tied to attracting such people as the economy diversifies. I hope that you proceed with this dissection of Idaho&#39;s heartlands with the caution and forethought of a surgeon. Idaho must not become like a poached elk carcass, abused and wasted. I strongly support the endangered Idaho wilderness core. But I am concerned that the rapid pace of formulating this wilderness bill will cause numerous roadless areas such as Scott Mountain,  Red Mountain, Steel Mountain, Deadwood River, South Boise-Yuba River areas in the Boise National Forest to be overlooked. In particular, I am concerned about the Sheep Creek and Bread winner areas of the Boise Forest. These areas of granitic outcroppings, mountain streams and dry meadowlands are of high scenic and recreational value. I urge you to take a hard look at Boise&#39;s backyard wilderness areas. It is because of Sheep and Breadwinner that I strongly oppose any hard release language in your wilderness bill.

Dr. Keith Taylor?
Thank you very much. I have only one comment because it was
brought through several and, Mr. Gab, you said it as well as any.
With respect to: &#39;I oppose any sort of hard release language that
would eliminate the possibility of any future wilderness designations,&#39; I agree with that statement. The question is how we implement it, I guess.
I appreciate that, and one other place, Mr. Gab, in your statement you said â€” you put it in quotes, and that&#39;s the only reason I
make any comment about
as something you are attributing to
me.

It

says: &#39;I find your desire to &#39;settle Idaho&#39;s wilderness question
once and for all&#39; rather hasty and very alarming.&#39;

don&#39;t think have ever said that.
Mr. Gab. was responding to a statement you made earlier this
spring even before you announced the hearings to be held. And
in quotes, but that was a statement
probably shouldn&#39;t have put
The Chairman. If we don&#39;t disturb that provision of the law,
would you object to a release language that preserved that provi
sion of the law?
Mr. Gab. Excuse me?
The Chairman. Would you object to release language that pre
served that provision of law?
Mr. Gab. I would object to any sort of hard release language, any
sort of language that would prohibit the further considerations.
The Chairman. All right. Thank you.
Congressman Craig.
Mr. Craig. Thank you very much, Senator McClure.
Let me follow up with a question as it relates to the release of
language, hard or soft, and your concern about congressional action
necessary to, after a given date or a given point in time, cause ad
ditional wilderness areas to exist.
I guess my reaction is, how about reversing it?
Mr. Gab. I
Mr. Craig. Let me finish, if I can, please.
For example, once it is designated wilderness, it takes congres
sional action to move it out of wilderness after the 1964 timeframe
which is the last of December 1983 for any additional exploration
for certain values that might be determined of national interest.
And I&#39;m talking primarily, let&#39;s say, of strategic minerals.
I guess I&#39;m saying if it&#39;s good for one side, maybe it ought to be
good for the other side, or at least it seems that we&#39;re saying once
it&#39;s in wilderness, it&#39;s in perpetuity, but we don&#39;t want other lands
to have the same option.
Would you respond to that?
Mr. Gab. I disagree with you.
Mr. Craig. Obviously you do, and I want to know why.
Mr. Gab. Once a land has been designated as wilderness, any and
all of its current economic or personal values, whatever, will
remain in that land.
Any land that is released, according to hard release language, or
released to private development, in my opinion, would not remain
as is and would probably not even be able to be considered for wil
derness 15 or 20 years down the road.
By releasing the land with a soft relese type of language, we
could consider this land if it has remained untouched, if it has not
had roads built into it and such.
By stating that wilderness is, on the one hand, also a hard re
lease language of a different sort, meaning that congressional
action would have to be taken to release it, I don&#39;t see anything
wrong with that. That, you might say, is a two-sided type thing.
Buy my point is, wilderness will remain wilderness once it is des
ignated as wilderness. Once it is released, I don&#39;t think it will stay
as is. I think that we need to have some sort of protection for it so
that it can be considered, so that the possibility for consideration
will exist.
Mr. Peterson. Could I respond to this, please; respond to the
same question?
My concern on the question of release, the release language, is
that there is a large area of wilderness out there that is being over
looked right now because of the urgency of getting this wilderness

336




bill. I think there are areas of wilderness such as Mallard-Larkins;
we have heard all the names â€” bigger names of areas: Clearwater
Forest, all this sort of thing.
Those are the larger areas that are getting most of the consider
ation in this particular hearing, in the bill, and this sort of thing.
There is a large area â€” wilderness area out there that is not given
fair consideration at this time. It&#39;s kind of a give-and-take compro
mise, if you will. I think at some point in time those areas should
be given fair consideration.
So that is my concern for hard release. It&#39;s kind of a compromis
ing situation, in that those areas are not given a fair shake.
The Chairman. Could I make one comment and ask a question
in regard to that.
Because of the two statements you have made, it seems to me to
be a direct opposition to each other. Do I understand you to be in
diametric opposition to each other?
Mr. Gab. No.
Mr. Peterson. No.
The Chairman. No. All right.
Soft release language, which both of you support, would leave it
open to multiple use choices for the next 10 or 15 years, depending
on whatever the period of time is. You, Mr. Gab, have said that,
due to the time, there won&#39;t be anything left to say.
And you have suggested we must study all of it now.
I guess the only thing you&#39;re in favor is not legislative at all

right now.

That&#39;s the only thing at which you are in agreement, because, to
me, what you are suggesting is, soft release, the very thing that
Mr. Gab said he can&#39;t tolerate.
Mr. Peterson. My concern with soft release is, these areas do
need more time to be studied and that they may have well
been
The Chairman. So you are opposed to soft release as well as hard
release?
Mr. Peterson. No. Let&#39;s get away from the linguistics of it.
The Chairman. OK.
Mr. Peterson. Basically, the way I feel is that there are wilder
ness areas that are not being given fair consideration right now
that should be preserved for some point in the future for further
consideration.
The Chairman. I think you&#39;re right; we ought to get away from
the semantics. Because we get hung up over the labels without un
derstanding what it is we&#39;re discussing.
Mr. Peterson. I listened to the testimony this morning and
heard about three different definitions of hard release, and I didn&#39;t
understand any of it. So if it is written in the bill, it should be writ
ten in plain language and all typed so we can understand it.
The Chairman. I understand. And I appreciate that.
Thank you all very much for your testimony.

I represent no spe cial interest group. I would like to thank Senator McClure and  Representative Craig for providing an opportunity for an ordinary citizen to share his or her opinion. I believe I am like the majority of Idaho citizens in that I work, I am a parent, I am involved in some community groups, and I care. I care about what happens in Idaho. I would also like to say I have a lot. I have two children, a spouse, a house, a car â€” those aren&#39;t necessarily ranked in order. I have a lot to be thankful for. The one thing I have very little of, though, is time. And I think what that kind of â€” what was just maybe illustrated, it&#39;s the common citizen like me sometimes that doesn&#39;t have the time to spend on gathering statistics and trying to figure out the semantics and the linguistics. I think a lot of us react on gut feelings, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, I know. You, Senator McClure and Representative Craig â€” you are so lucky in that you have staff to brief you on issues, research the problems, provide you with facts, define hard release and soft re lease for you, and surround you with statistics. I wish that I had a staff. Then I could ask them to research my base feelings and provide me with support for those. However, I don&#39;t, and I apologize for not having any statistics and hard facts because that is sometimes what sells certain view points. What I do have, though, is strong feelings that I would like to share. We, in Idaho, are so lucky to have acres and acres of un touched wilderness. I feel we have to protect that wilderness, not only for the citizens of Idaho, but citizens of the whole United States and, really, the whole world. This is where I wish I had some statistics. When you look at the developed areas of the United States versus the undeveloped areas, it appears obvious that we&#39;ve devel oped far more than we&#39;ve left alone.

The areas we are considering today are our weekend hiking and  fishing retreats, the places a few hours&#39; drive from population cen ters such as Boise, the areas available to anyone. On the matter of cost of wilderness experience, let me point out that a backpack and a sturdy pair of boots are a lot cheaper than any motorized vehicle. I&#39;m sure you have been told earlier in the hearings that only those with truly superior strength can partake of the wilderness. I&#39;m a 120-pound weakling, in school always the last person chosen to be on anyone&#39;s athletic team. I have terrible knees, and two surgeries to prove it. But I discov ered there is one form of exercise I can enjoy. I can put one foot in front of the other. This is called walking, and if you do it in the wilderness, it is called hiking. If done while carrying a pack, it is called backpacking. Let&#39;s talk about the economic value of wilderness. Take McCall, for example, the town that was supposed to die when its outmoded sawmill was closed. Try buying groceries at Shavers, the local market, on a Saturday, and as you stand tenth in line, look around you and observe all those tourists buying merchandise. A healthy forest that can supply us with a good watershed for agriculture, clean streams for fish to thrive in, habitat for game and nongame wildlife, and solitude for people will be an economic asset to us forever. Hiking in a clearcut is about as esthetically pleasing as golfing at the city dump. I urge you in your legislation to allow at least 50 percent of Idaho&#39;s remaining 6.5 million acres of roadless land to be classified wilderness. Included in this should be the 10-area endangered Idaho wilderness core, especially the Payette Crest region. During my frequent hikes there I am always amazed and thank ful that such beautiful lakes and vistas are available so close by. I oppose hard release. There is plenty of sold, uncut timber in Idaho now. As we consider how much less Idaho wilderness we will pass along to future generations than was left for our use and pleasure, let us strive not to go down in history as the greedy generation,",,EDWINA ALLEN,"BOISE, IDAHO",Allen,Edwina,h1d1,"allen, edwina",Boise (CITY); Payette Crest (LANDFORM),text

I have submitted written tes  timony, so this is an excerpt that may not flow as well as I would have wished. But I&#39;ll just start out by saying that the ecological reasons for preserving large tracts of wilderness cannot be overstat ed. It is unfortunate that our limited way of computing economic values has not evolved to the extent that we can arrive at a true monetary value of wilderness. Some components are quantitatively measured â€” the board feet of timber and its value, the metric tons of ore and its value, and the rudiments of assessing some recre ational values. But our economists lag behind our philosophers and cannot find a way to value the intrinsic worth of an untouched landscape. What we have not been able to put behind a dollar sign we know intuitively is valuable. Wildlands, untouched by man&#39;s modifications, are not commod ities; they are dwindling, nonrenewable resources, and by their very scarcity, their values are increased. To some people in Idaho, any additional designated wilderness sounds excessive when this State already has the most wilderness in the lower 48 States. But to others of us who have lived in other parts of this country or the world, we realize that Idaho cannot have too much wilder ness, that on a national or global scale a great proportion of the potential wilderness that remains is within the borders of this State.  For a planning perspective there cannot be too much wilderness. Let&#39;s not be conservative in designating wilderness now as we may preclude the best management options later. For this reason, I en courage you to incorporate the notion of, heaven forbid, soft release into the Idaho wilderness bill to permit further consideration in the next Forest Service planning cycle of roadless areas not now designated as wilderness. As I have not prepared an acreage recommendation for the spe cific proposed wilderness areas, I will encourage you to include, at the minimum, the endangered Idaho wilderness core of 10 areas mentioned earlier today.

Thank you, Senator McClure, Representative     Craig.  My name is William Drummond. I first want to say that I sup port the endangered Idaho wilderness core as put forth by the con servationist groups. Especially, I would urge that you consider the following areas: The Lost River Range, including Borah Peak; Sawtooth Wilderness additions; and also the White Clouds-Boulder area. In addition, in the Clearwater National Forest, I would urge you to consider the Great Burn-Cayuse Creek. I have a bachelor of science degree in forestry and worked for the Forest Service on the Kelly Creek District in the Clearwater National Forest. I helped in cruising or inventorying many of the areas which are under consideration for the wilderness. The land itself is very steep; it contains poor species for mer chantability; White Fir, Subalpine fir and Alpine Fir instead of White Pine, Ponderosa Pine and Douglas Fir which is especially merchantable. In addition, my second point is that as you listen to timber indus try representatives today, be aware of a recent Wall Street Journal article which appeared on July 19, 1983. I&#39;d like to read a portion of that article. It begins, and I quote, &#39;With the influx of new businesses, many southerners now talk of timber with the reverence once reserved for cotton and tobacco. Last year, for instance, Georgia-Pacific Corp. moved its headquar ters to Atlanta from Portland, Oregon. Only two paper mills were started in the United States last year, and both are deep in Dixie.&#39; In addition, one of the local representatives was quoted as saying: &#39;The timber companies are moving south. Cheap land, cheap labor, cheap taxes in an ideal growing condition.&#39; The fact is that the timber industry in the Northwest is becom ing less and less important to the economy, as evidenced by deficit sales, the bailout of the timber companies from signed contracts and also, closer to home, the fact that there are no plans to rebuild the Riggins Sawmill which burned. In conclusion, I would like to say I support soft release, which, in my mind, is that the wilderness areas which are not designated wilderness areas at the end of this particular process will still be allowed to be considered wildernessa areas in the future.","Thank you.

First let me begin by saying that I understand that you two gen tlemen must consider a national constituency. There are a lot of people outside of Idaho who are also very concerned about the wild life in this area.  348  I am     a native, and I&#39;m going to talk to you about the State today. As you know, the whole economy of Idaho is based on natural re sources. And last year the Idaho State Legislature struggled for months to try to balance their budget and fund education with a shrinking tax base and with the endowment lands for the State which go to education shrinking to almost half in some cases be cause of environmental concerns. With the recession and with our shrinking land base, hard times fell hard on Idaho during this recession, so the economy of the State is something that must be seriously considered with wilder ness. I own a T-shirt that says â€” it&#39;s really cute; it says, Idaho is what America was. And I think that&#39;s true. Idaho retains a certain amount of fron  tier atmosphere and old fashioned charm. It&#39;s beautiful and pris tine. And a lot of people come here and say, I want that old-fashionedness for my children. I want them to know that there is someplace still left that&#39;s old-fashioned, like Idaho. And I want that for my children, too. I grew up here and would like to give that to them. Oftentimes when we get a new puppy or a new kitten, they are so charming and they are so cute, we think, well, if there was just some way we could make the puppy stay a puppy. The only way we can do that is to somehow take away the dynamic life of the puppy and preserve its body. I think perhaps this additional proposal of wilderness will do just that. Idaho, as any other State, has just as much right to grow just as the puppy has the right to grow and to be a dog. And that if you continue to take more wilderness throughout the years, you will be preserving the body and making it harder and harder for the citi zens of the State of Idaho to continue to grow. Life is dynamic. It must grow, and so must the State.  Thank you.",,MEG C. KEENAN,"BOISE, IDAHO",Keenan,Meg C.,h1d1,"keenan, meg c.",America (COUNTRY),text

Senator McClure and Congressman Craig.     351  Senator, this week one of your colleagues from the Senate will, I believe, be floating down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. I myself have had the fortune of traveling to the northernmost part of this continent and paddling about a 200-mile stretch of the Great George River that flows into the Unguava Bay area. Closer to home, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget an afternoon that my two young boys and I spent walking up to the highest peak of the Trinities to the lookout up there where you could view all the way to Nevada and to Utah and to Oregon. It was not only a thrill for them; it was to me. What these three areas have in common together with, I think, all of the areas under the consideration of your committee is their wilderness aspect. And that aspect is, I believe, in the world at large today a rare commodity. The already designated wilderness area of the Salmon River is for our friends from the East, just as much as the northern part of Quebec are for me. And these roadless areas in Idaho can be for our future generations. I think it&#39;s folly for the committee to center its inquiry on the question of how many more wilderness acreas for Idaho. I really suggest that we are all in agreement on this situation. If there is a portion on that map that can be characterized as pure wilderness beauty, then it ought to deserve the protection of your legislation. To speak against it is really to speak against Nature itself. Those voices that would advocate a different use now, a use that will permanently change, alter or, in fact, destroy some of this wilderness are only temporary voices motivated by their economic masters, if you will. The few remaining acres that we have on a worldwide basis ought to be protected if we can do so. To yield to the tempta tions to present these acreas to economic prostitution is, I think, shortsighted.  Thank you.","Thank you.

Aug-09-1983,aug-09-1983-kelly-mary-e,,Kelly Creek (STREAM),"Kelly, Mary E.",,Boise,"Boise, Idaho",f,"Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Senator McClure. I would like to submit as my testimony a letter I wrote to the editor of the Idaho Statesman because it addresses a semantic issue that I have heard a few times in the last hour. The letter appeared  July 30, 1983. It reads:  Dear Editor, I know that newspaper headlines are written to fill a certain space, so that sometimes it&#39;s hard to accurately reflect a story with a headline. There was a headline in the July 26 Statesman that was a case in point. It said, and I quote, conservationists want 2 million more wilds acres. Conserva tionists don&#39;t want more wildland. The wildland is already there, and we just want to keep some of it that way.  If conservationists want 2 million acres kept wild, that means they â€” we â€” are willing to see about 4 million acres that is wild now not be protected. There is about 6.5 million acres of wildlife on Idaho&#39;s national forests which has no protection insuring it will stay wild. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much to ask to see about one-third of that to be protected to stay just the way it is. So please remember, when you hear that someone wants more wilderness, that really means they want to protect some part of  353  land that is already wild. The real question is, how much left wild land will Idaho have in 10 years. I think 2 million acres is probably too little to protect, because that really means we&#39;re going to build about two-thirds. The point is, you cannot create wilderness; you can destroy it, or you can protect it. Thank you very much.","Thank you very much.

Congressman Craig.
Mr. Craig. I have a couple of questions to the person who just
last spoke saying you cannot create wilderness.
Ms. Kelly. Correct.
Mr. Craig. I guess that frustrates me a little bit, and I say that
because for the last 3 years I have been serving on a committee
that&#39;s directly involved with this issue, the Interior Committee in
the House.
We have looked at a variety of proposals; some of them have
passed that committee and passed the House and passed the
Senate. Throughout the United States in which there were lands
that had once been logged and once been roaded and once been
mined, but were then put into wilderness, I guess depending upon
the topography, depending upon the environment, depending upon
the management the Forest Service gave those lands following
their logging, following their mining and following their roading, at
least the people in Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and
other places felt they met wilderness qualifications and chose to
have them put into the national wilderness system and the ConSo I guess what I&#39;m saying is, you can create wilderness out of
lands that were at one time nonwilderness and used. We&#39;ve been
doing it for the last 3 years on a rather progressive basis.
Ms. Kelly. Excuse me, Representative Craig. Weren&#39;t those
lands originally wild wilderness lands before they were logged?
Isn&#39;t that a question of reconstructing or trying to reconstruct
lands back to their original state?
They were not created as logged areas.
Mr. Craig. No, ma&#39;am. What I&#39;m saying is that under multiple
use management, they once again became very nearly what they
were prior to the designated use the Forest Service deemed they
should be used under. And once that had happened, it was decided
that they could be designated wilderness and meet the criteria that
would support as wilderness criteria.
Mr. Blair. Congressman, could I respond just briefly to that?
Mr. Craig. Sure.
Mr. Blair. One thing that you would have to take into consider
ation in a difference between Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Florida,
and other places you mentioned is that most of those places prob
ably receive a minimum of 40 inches of rainfall per year and have
excellent soils available upon which to rehabilitate those lands.
Mr. Craig. Well, I think I did say that depending on the environ
ment and the type of management applied
Mr. Blair. Right.
Mr. Craig continuing]. The lands were able to repair them
selves.

Mr. Blair. That does not necessaily apply in Idaho because of
the harsh conditions we have.
Mr. Craig. I guess the point I was trying to make â€” and then I&#39;ll
turn it back to you, Senator McClure â€” is that there are clearly
areas where the statement that the last speaker made as a general
statement simply does not apply in this Nation of ours. We have
decided congressionally that we can, in fact, recreate wilderness.
Mr. Nelson. Sir? May I reply to that, sir?

Senator McClure, and Representative Craig, while I applaud the advantages of a statewide wilderness bill, I&#39;ll just give on local input, I do have some trepidations about such a bill.  One is that it would focus on now much wilderness is allowed for the State. I believe we should look at a larger context of how much our wilderness, our whole country deserves because these are Fed eral lands and they are owned by all the people. Also, we have the wilderness areas that do not know of State boundaries because the wilderness areas were here first. One exam ple would be Bitterroot which expands both in Idaho and in Mon tana. Another concern of mine is how opponents of wilderness delin eate between wilderness and nonwilderness lands. They&#39;re labeled nonwilderness lands multiple use, as if to insinuate that wilderness lands have only single use. I find it amazing that a nonwilderness area that permits logging, which destroys the spawning beds of trouts, damages watersheds, hampers biological research, creates ugliness, mars the pleasure of recreationists and does immeasurable harm to native plants and animals is somehow multiple use, while a system that perserves all those values, as does wilderness, is not multiple use. I favor wilderness designation for the Borah Peak area and for the White Clouds Mountains.  368     Wilderness designation for the Borah Peak area has little opposi tion, and I think it&#39;s appropriate to preserve the highest peak in the State in honor of one of our greatest public figures. As for the White Clouds, there are numerous reasons for wilder ness designations: The spawning grounds for the fish, which feed into the East Fork of the Salmon, and the deer and elk, which summer in this area. And then those who have hiked in the White Clouds would all agree on the special scenic and recreational values. These are all well worth preserving.",,ANDY BRUNELLE,"BOISE, IDAHO",Brunelle,Andy,h1d1,"brunelle, andy",Selway-Bitterroot (LANDFORM); Montana (STATE); White Cloud Mountains (LANDFORM); White Clouds (WILDERNESS); East Fork (STREAM); Salmon (STREAM),text

Ms. Fletcher. I am a second-year law student at the University
of Idaho and I&#39;m also a resident of Boise.
I have had an opportunity to see both north and south.
There will be nothing particularly earth-shattering about what I
have to say to you, and little, if anything, that you haven&#39;t already
heard during this long and impressive day of hearing.
Nonetheless, I have waited here long enough that I am going to
have my brief say.
It is decidedly preferable for Idahoans to maximize wilderness
designation rather than minimize it. I urge you to include the En
dangered Idaho wilderness core â€” and I won&#39;t enumerate; you know
it as well as I do â€” in your legislation. It is critically important to
retain these 10 fine example of wildland from commercial en
croachment.
But, Senator, this inclusion is only the bare bones. There are
many other areas which must be carefully studied, including, but
certainly not limited to, our own Trinities just outside of Boise,
your own, Senator, &#39;Mann&#39; Creek, Fourth of July Creek and
Brownlee.
Part of our unique, independent and worthwhile quality of life
here is built on such open spaces and wildlands. In a resourcehungry world, Idaho&#39;s people have managed to retain these pristine
areas. They haven&#39;t let them open up.
The people have clearly demonstrated that they want to pass on
these areas for future generations. And for this reason, we have
kept the sagebrush rebels at bay. It&#39;s been a hard fight. We have
also resisted thermal power development.
The timber industry bleakly prophesies increasing unemploy
ment in Idaho unless 90 percent of the roadless areas are opened to
roads. This, Senator, is shortsighted.
Idaho&#39;s wildland must be managed as a long term asset which
will provide employment in the area of recreation.

Today I wish to go on record favoring wilderness protection spe cifically for the Lick Creek and Needles areas which are part of the Payette Crest. To see this country on foot, as I have, is to appreci ate it. It is composed of rugged, steep glacially carved granite peaks that shelter hanging valleys and meadows. Many high mountain lakes fed by pristine watershed exist here in elevations exceeding     8,500 feet.  These area have easy access from Boise and McCall and would relieve heavy use of existing wilderness. These areas are also a value to the wildlife who live there: Elk, deer, black bear, cougar, bobcat, lynx and beaver. Protection of areas that still remain essentially untraveled, un changed by man and undiscovered need wilderness status. Groups wishing that Lick Creek and the Needles be opened for use such as offroad vehicles, timbering or mining fail to recognize the true values of this wild land. But properly protected, these areas could provide renewable re sources essentially forever. Before concluding, I would like to take this opportunity to ex press my full support for Idaho&#39;s Endangered Wilderness Core, the ten areas which you are very familiar with. They are listed in my written comments. I also wish to express my support for the conservationists&#39; wilder ness alternative that will be submitted in October of 1983 in detail. In addition, I wish the record to show that I am opposed to any land release language that may be a part of upcoming legislation.

Summer homes and subdivisions are taking their habitat, and logging industries are building roads into the forest. So our wildlife is becoming ever more scarce. Unless the wilder ness is safe for them, one day there may not be many around for our children and our grandchildren to enjoy. Our family has hiked many trails in the wilderness area, and we have enjoyed the meadows with many beautiful wild flowers, the rivers, the creeks, the lakes and the forest, and even the rocks; also the wildlife, which is always more fun away from the main trav  eled road. Many people who cannot afford to buy an RV can buy a back pack and a sleeping bag and put together enough dry fruit or what ever for a week&#39;s vacation and so they can hike in the high coun  try.

I also strongly oppose hard release language, since no one can so clearly foresee the future needs of the United States. As can easily be seen, when the logging industry has exhausted the timber possibilities of an area, the Forest Service closed the roads so that the area is not accessible by vehicle anyway. The streams are degraded by soil erosion and wildlife habitat is de stroyed. But if the scenic hunting or fishing potential of an area has not been degraded by logging, then hunters, backpackers and tourists will come from far away to enjoy the attractions.

Senator McClure, Senator Craig, I&#39;m glad to speak in front of you today. I&#39;m a native of Idaho, over 32 years in Idaho. I was born and raised in Payette, I knew Senator McClure and his daughter when  I  was a child.     396  I&#39;ve hunted in these areas ever since I&#39;ve been able to get a li cense. Every year it seems to be harder and harder to find an area to hunt because of logging explorations. Most of the time the logs â€” the roads alone cost more than the logging to produce. Taxpayers build these roads, not logging profits. A case in point is Kelley Creek-Cayouse River in northern Idaho. This is a nationally recognized blue ribbon trout stream. Prime habitat for elk, gray wolves, moose, and grizzly bear. This area is being threatened by logging operations. It has been estimated that the cost of building the road, $80,000 to $150,000 per month will exceed the value of the timber cost, timber harvest. There is no justification, in my opinion, for projects that do not either show a profit or have a high aesthetic value. A better plan would be to subsidize the logging companies for the amount of the roads cost and keep the areas roadless. But the best overall plan would be for our Idaho congressional delegates to truly represent the people of Idaho and not the devel opers. Setting aside the emotional trauma that might be produced and seeing the White Clouds leveled, Middle Fork of the Salmon River dammed or Red Fish Lake full of oil rigs, it is easy to build a ra tional case for a need for wilderness area. I would like to see included in wilderness all the endangered Idaho wilderness core, which has been mentioned before. I would very much like to see soft release working in any legisla tion. I oppose hard release and I would urge that 50 percent of all of the 6.5 million acres of forest roadless land be considered wilder ness.

I have lived in States where no land is allowed to be wild, where the roadless area exist only as calendar art and where there are more shopping center acres than forested areas. I favor preservation of at least 2 million acres of the remaining 6 million and I would endorse the conservationists proposal in its en tirety. And I do so on behalf of the citizens of those States who have no wildlife areas, who come to Idaho to enjoy nature at its fullest. And also for future generations who do not have the opportunity to vote who would benefit greatly from this natural beauty of this land. I am concerned about the language that might be used. I think it would be presumptuous of us to anticipate the wishes of the unborn people and egotistical of us to assume that we know what might be best for them.

Getting advice from my wife I want to thank you, Senator McClure, and I&#39;m very grateful to be here with you and Mr. Craig. I would like to ask for wilderness consideration of the following area. The identity is south Boise and Yuba River, RARE II area. It joins the Sawtooth wilderness on the south. Elevations vary  from about 5,000 to 10,000 feet. We, that is, my wife and I, backpack into this area with junior high students from the Methodist church. In fact, we did some of that last week with about 16 kids, on some of their first backpack ing trips. It is a beautiful area with rugged mountain peaks, beautiful lakes to fish, mule deer to watch. Vegetation is white bark pine, sub-alpine fir habitat type with a few Engelman spruce in the stream bottoms and on wet situation. The white bark pine grows to timberline and often is deformed or stunted by wind, cold or draught. Undergrowth vary consider  421  ably and range from Idaho fescue on exposed sites to elk sedge and dwarf huckleberry on moderate sites. Solids are formed from south batholith granites being sandy loams and the loams. These habitat sites are very low timber po tential. Forage can only sustain light wildlife grazing. The important use is water. This water production for the Boise area and the irrigated lands in Canyon County. Only the lower slopes adjacent to these areas and below 5,000 feet have Douglas fir and lodge pole pine and with very careful management could be logged. I, as a retired forester, would recom mend that the capabilities of this area be examined very thorough ly for wilderness designation to maintain watershed values. In conclusion, I believe all our land should be examined accord ing to its capabilities and this is the reason I&#39;m against the pro posed release of all lands not now designated wilderness without further study.

It is not a question of how many acres of wilderness Idaho should have, but what is  the best use for the land itself. Some of the land under consider ation is well suited for logging, mining, and grazing. And other land is best suited only to maintaining hunting, fishing, and hiking, which are valuable economic resources in Idaho. Wilderness status for this land will also protect our watersheds with its valuable water, the lifeline of Idaho. Excessive erosion caused by mining and logging activities in areas not suited to such action, can severely damage our watersheds, which in turn hurts the farmer, rancher, and every person in Idaho. It is impossible to protect our fish and wildlife to insure quality water for Idaho and to leave some solitude and beauty for the future generations if we release all land not now in wilderness. Many areas need to be studied further for final boundaries and acreages. And in my written testimony I have listed some areas which I will not go into now. But I would like to say that it seems a shame, for example, that 8,000 acres of the Salmo-Priest area, which is the home for the mountain caribou, would need to be taken out of wilderness. To me these and the red â€” giant red cedars there should be put in wilder ness.  Also it seems a shame that Mount Borah, Idaho&#39;s highest peak, in a wilderness situation. Timber and mineral values are very low in this area. I am strongly against any bill which would permanently bar any wilderness consideration for land not now declared wilderness. I urge that the areas mentioned in my written testimony, as well as some other areas, be designated wilderness to protect the most crit ical areas for fish, wildlife, recreation, and watershed. I understand plans are underway to prevent exact boundaries and acreages and this will be proposed in October. Thank you.",,ZILDA U.

I live at 1200 Holden Lane, Boise. I have lived in the State for  about 13 years. I&#39;d like to second the statement that Barbara Bil lings has made to you. I believe we should look at some of these conversions and nonconversions from wilderness in economic light. I believe that there is ample evidence to suggest that the area around Boise and southeast Idaho is easier, it&#39;s easier for employ ers to locate here and attract with people because they can go to roadless areas in the wilderness for recreation. This is especially true for areas that can be reached on the weekend. I believe that we should try to maintain a variety of recreational areas. My experience indicates we seem to have an adequate amount of area that is roaded that people can access with motor ized vehicles. It might seem at this point in Idaho that perhaps we have enough area close in that we can use for wilderness experi     ence.

As you are probably aware, this high desert region is of question able commercial value from a timber, mineral, grazing, or water rights standpoint. This region does have significant wildlife re sources. It contains one of Idaho&#39;s few existing native wheat grass lands stand, a reasonable timber sheltering area for the existing deer and elk herds and is one of Idaho&#39;s bighorn sheep ranges, having provided a transplant site for that particular purpose in the 1960&#39;s.

Senator, Congressman, I&#39;m an attorney in pri vate practice here in Boise speaking for myself. I grew up outside of Idaho and I came here as the chief of division of natural re sources, for the Idaho attorney general.  In that capacity I had an opportunity to work with both of your  with the various land management agencies and with the various user groups from industry to environmental ists and based on that experience and those perspectives, I have one, I guess broad, philosophical comment to make. Idaho, at present, does not have enough or too much wilderness and in that connection I would support an extension of the wilder ness system beyond that proposed by the Forest Service and their RARE II proposal. I have personally seen the overcrowding that&#39;s existed in other wilderness areas outside the State of Idaho. And the day will come when Idaho&#39;s wilderness will face the same pressures resulting in permits for access, closing of certain areas to camping, the prohibi tion of wood fires and in the worst possible case, carrying out your excrement with you. So I believe that an extension of this system would be a farsighted measure which would do justice to the efforts that both of you have conducted in the past. As to specifics, I&#39;ve been in the White Clouds and I&#39;ve been in the Mount Borah area. I&#39;ve also probably camped and hiked and canoed rapids in maybe 20 to 30 wilderness areas throughout the country. And these areas are as worthy of protection as any of the areas that I have seen. Two final comments. I would support soft release in any wilder ness bill. And I would like to thank both yourselves and the vari ous land management agencies for protecting as much wilderness as we have in Idaho in the present.

I favor classifying as wilderness approximately 3 million acres of Idaho&#39;s remaining 6.5 million acres of roadless forest lands. I also support wilderness classification of lands designated by the Idaho Conservation League as endangered Idaho wilderness core. And I&#39;m adamantly opposed to hard release language in any wil derness bill because future changes in Idaho&#39;s demographics, econo my and wildlife populations behoove us at a future date to classify roadless as wilderness. My advocacy of wilderness is based on the overwhelming evi dence that wilderness status will render the highest and best uses of such land for both the quality of life and economic standpoints. Road these areas and log and mine them, and as both the U.S. Forest Service and the Idaho Fish and Game Department acknowl edge, the quality of fishing, hunting, and watershed and scenery will certainly decline. Logging scenic de facto wilderness and therby locking them up in a network of clearcuts and logging roads precludes or diminishes other uses as wilderness backpacking, horsepacking, camping, fish ing, hunting, photography, and nature study. The outdoor recreation review commission once projected a ten fold increase in wilderness recreational use from 1960 to the year 2000 and a recent forest survey confirmed that wilderness recrea tion is increasing several times faster than road accessible camp ground use. Crowding has become a major problem in portions of     466  the Sawtooth, Hells Canyon and River of No Return Wilderness Areas, and consequently in order to maintain quality wilderness recreation, for which Idaho is nationally famous, and to bolster the State&#39;s recreation and tourism economy, which is now second only to agriculture, additional wilderness lands are needed. Furthermore, the economic impact on Idahoans of logging and roading of potential wilderness lands is, cumulatively, negative. The cost of building logging roads in these marginally commercial timberlands often exceeds the monetary receipts to the Forest Service for timber sold.

The rest of the country sees Idaho as a place unlike anything that&#39;s left here. Idaho will realize benefits from our wilderness, both economic and otherwise, as people have said. Wise manage ment can provide for both a healthy Idaho economy and the health of our natural systems. There&#39;s plenty of room for improvement in the wisdom of our management.

In my occupation I help to meet people&#39;s need for adequate housing at a price they can afford. So much of our building products are provided by the lumber in dustry and they try to meet our demand effectively and peacefully. They would not be in operation if their products were not used. As one example, the curtailment of cutting of forestry defined lumber products has increased dramatically in the last 15 years. D pine went up from $300 per thousand board feet in 1969 to over $1,000 to $2,000 at this time, the dimension lumber from $100 in 1969 to over $300 at this time. Our lumber industry has been very efficient and they have tried to make the best of the cuts that they do have. We are now using trusses and roof material that uses have in some of the products that our lumber industry has made. I have a TJI here. There&#39;s finger-joint material and using knotty pine and yet cutting the veneer to stretch our lumber supplies sc that I have something to     use.  We&#39;re using finger-jointed studs to get everything out of the trees that are cut in the most efficient way possible. As they say, the only thing wasted now in the lumber industry is the scream of as sault. When we lock up our forests, the woods go to waste. When trees mature they die. They do not wait for another 50 years to be used.  We need wood products. To lock up our forest when there is such a need would be the same as not harvesting a field of grain when it is ripe and ready by the people, leaving people in need.  I have backpacked many times in the Sawtooth Wilderness Area. have gone to and from Atlanta over the trail to Grandjean on foot. I&#39;ve camped on the shores of the high mountain lakes. I&#39;ve been a scoutmaster and have used the forest areas on our outings. When I was a boy as a boy scout and was an Eagle Scout, I loved the wilderness. But I can also see the need for properly managed multiple use forests. When one goes into the wilderness areas and sees the prime lumber wasting away due to old age, it is a waste that we should not have a great deal of. Lumbering, mining, and recreation can coexist very well in our forest land for everyone&#39;s benefit. Lockup is not the answer. Multiple use is the answer. Thank you.",,N.

Senator McClure and Senator Symms, thank  you for the opportunity to voice my opinion on the Idaho lands use question. At the present time, there is plenty of recreational land in Idaho as well as plenty of natural resources for development. Therefore, I believe our concern today should be geared more toward 200 years from now, rather than the next 20 years. In 200 years from now, oil and wood would no longer be used as we will be able to use synthetics. The recreational activities in nat ural areas will be needed more than ever. As an example of in creased use of primitive areas, it is now a privilege to win a permit on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. If we maintain this river in its present state, do you feel that there will be pressure to float the Middle Fork 200 years from now? There will be great pressure on our population also during the next 200 years. America is the last bastion of free enterprise and people from all over the world will continue to come to America. In speaking of free enterprise, the economics of preserving wilderness areas with the accompanying tourist industry will have great returns to Idahoans of the future. I request that we increase our wilderness by including the White Clouds, Great Burn, Kelly Creek, Mallard-Larkins, Selkirk Crest as wilderness areas. Thank you.  484","Thank you. Mr. Ford, I understood you to indi
cate that you&#39;ll have the detailed information on the 10 areas that
you&#39;ve identified available to the committee by early September; is




that correct?

Mr. Ford. Senator, yes. We will provide information on those in
the hearing record by then. Now, that information will not, except
for areas we have completed the fieldwork on, have boundaries. It
will have detailed information on the values and our defense of
why we think they ought to be wilderness.
The Chairman. You indicated that you would have information
to us prior to October 1 with respect to some other areas.
Mr. Ford. With respect to a statewide proposal, Senator, yes, we
will. And that will include boundary proposal.
The Chairman. Well, I don&#39;t know what others may do, but that
seems like a reasonable time frame, as far as I&#39;m concerned, and I
will, for myself, attempt to assist as you attempt to satisfy us by
giving enough time to get that information prior to October 1.
The Chairman. Thank you.
Senator Symms. Thank you very much. The thought just oc
curred to me when I heard the applause and the argument for the
different speakers, that probably first we ought to have a round of
applause for the chairman. I left and went to a meeting in Nampa
and got back at 4 and your staying on here, Mr. Chairman, and I
think that the people here, as I said in my opening statement, we
certainly owe you a debt of gratitude.
If anybody in here deserves a round of applause, it&#39;s you to sit
here and be so patient all day and I certainly appreciate it and I
know many people out there do. But I do have one question and it
came to mind when I heard Keith Larson testify here.
As an occupation in carpentry and home construction, Keith, do
you have any idea how many people feel like you do? I mean, I see
this witness list today and I want to aks you the same question,
Pat. How many people do you represent, Pat Ford and Keith? Do
you represent one person, individual?
Mr. Larson. I represent myself only, speaking for myself only.
But involved in the occupation of homebuilding, the contacts I
make with people who do need homes and are now being priced out
of the market and much of this, of course, is due to the high cost of
materials.
Senator Symms. How many people do you suppose in your trade
that would get up here and say the same thing that you just said,
that you work with and come in contact with?
Mr. Larson. I&#39;m sure 100 percent of them.
Senator Symms. Or a lot of them.
Mr. Larson. They&#39;ve seen this and the need is there. Many of
them going up in the woods see them being wasted because
Senator Symms. Pat, I might ask you a question, now. You repre
sent the Idaho Conservation League and I&#39;ve known you, worked
with you for many years. How many people are there in the Idaho
Conservation League and how many of the people in the Idaho
Conservation League have duplicate memberships in other organi
zations like the Wilderness Society and so forth that are gear clubs
and others that testify here today?




485

Mr. Ford. Senator, there about 1,350 members in the Idaho Con
servation League and I represent all of them. I have no idea how
many are in other organizations. I&#39;m sure some are.
A Voice. Senator Symms, I am priced out of the housing market
and I would rather have trees.
Ms. Carriveau. Senator Symms, my husband is also a carpenter,
in the carpenter trade and I guess that would make 99 percent of
the carpenters that aren&#39;t for. Because my husband just went up to
the Selway and after seeing nine moose last weekend, you can&#39;t
tear him away from wilderness, I tell you that.
Senator Symms. Well, I&#39;m not arguing that point. I&#39;ve seen many
moose myself when you drive over to eastern Idaho and see them
driving up the highway, up toward Yellowstone Park. And it&#39;s a
beautiful sight and then driving onto the park area and you can
see them from the road and so forth.
But the question I&#39;m trying to get at is we have these hearings
and many, many sincere people come in and testify and yet, you
know, as I listen to the testimony today many of you who are
saying the same thing are also members of the same organizations.
I&#39;m just wondering how many people out there that are in the
Wilderness Society are also in the Idaho Conservation League and
how big of a bulk of our contingency is this that we&#39;re hearing
from here and what, you know, everybody didn&#39;t have time to be
here today.
And some of you have made time to be here because of your sin
cere interest in the question and that&#39;s why I just asked the ques
tion. Many of the homebuilders and carpenters and contractors are
out working today and they&#39;re not able to be here.
A Voice. We came from Ketchum, round trip, and left little chil
dren.
Senator Symms. I can tell one thing, that the numbers may be
the emotional enthusiasm and certainly we welcome it.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. I might say too, Mr. Ford,
on the record what I&#39;ve said off the record that I appreciate the
conversation we have had in the past as well as here today with
respect to the difference between various kinds of release language.
I look forward to working with various people who look at this
question to forge an appropriate kind of language. That would cer
tainly meet the bulk, certainly the majority, if not all of Idaho.
Thank you very much for your testimony.

I am not an outdoors woman and at age 67 am not apt to become one. I will not address myself, therefore, to the specific forest areas.  486     We in the West with our wealth of natural resources, have become like the proverbial lad whose money is burning a hole in his pocket. We are impatient to use our resources up, to use them all up and to use them all up now. The mythical rugged individualists of yore have been replaced by organized groups of individuals with political clout, an addiction to welfare euphemistically called subsidies and seemingly an insatia ble acquisitiveness. Even those whose livelihood is best served by roadless areas managed as wilderness have succumbed to the prof ligacy of the age. Agriculture is recognized as the leading industry of Idaho. Agri culture is dependent on a stable water supply. Watersheds in wil derness areas are protected from erosion caused by road building and logging and therefore they provide a stable water supply, qual ity water supply, not a deluge in the spring followed by little or no water during the growing season. According to a 1975 study by the U.S. Water Resources Council, the national average per capita per day rate of water withdrawal, excluding hydropower coming from all sources, not just public sup plies, was about 1,600 gallons. It was exceeded in Idaho by 21,000 gallons. Idaho is thinly populated and has a large acreage under irriga tion. Nevertheless, this statistic underlines the fact that there&#39;s gold in those proposed wilderness areas and that gold is water. Wilderness is a bank savings account. It provides protection for a diversity of plant and animal life. Loss of diversity of a species is of grave concern to scientists. In many plants we&#39;ve found remedies for some of man&#39;s ailments. Wilderness is multiple use. Why be in a hurry to limit out op tions in the future? I support maximum Wilderness.","hank you, Mrs. Longworthy. Mr. Longworthy.",HELEN LONGWORTHY,"BOISE, IDAHO",Longworthy,Helen,h1d1,"longworthy, helen",,text

My name is Ed Longworthy. I live in Boise with my wife who also lives  in Boise. Back in the Jurassic period, geologists tell us, there were some mighty dinosaurs crashing around the primordial swamps. Among them was Brontosauras, which means thunder lizard. This reptile was 70 feet long, 20 feet high, and weighed up to 35 tons. Its sheer bulk rendered it an exceeding clumsy animal and since its brain weighed less than a pound, its stupidity was probably also excessive. It had to have a second brain or ganglia at the base of its tail to control the parts that trailed behind it, like the rear-end driver on a fire truck ladder. You can imagine the tremendous amounts of food required to ac tivate this overgrown monster. It was a herbivore or plant eater and some scientists reasoned that it literally ate itself out of exist ence. It consumed the plants or just smashed them down faster than nature could grow them.  487     In other words, it was too big for its habitat, a biological mistake. And like all biological mistakes, it became extinct. Now all we find of it are fossilized bone buried under tons of sediment. Smaller creatures, in better balance with their environment, took over the  range of dinosaurs. Now we mammals of the late Quarternary period may be in clined to congratulate ourselves on having outlived the dinosaurs. Pretty hard to imagine such ungainly, greedy dragons competing with us today, isn&#39;t it? Or is it? Let us consider the modern logging truck, Take a drive between Boise and Lowman some weekend and count how many of these thunder lizards threaten your peace and tranquility. They are 65 feet long, 14 feet high and when loaded outweigh Brontosauras by 5 tons. Legally, that is. Many exceed the legal weight limits and Brontosauras too. In appetite they rank with any dinosaur, requiring outrageous amounts of increasingly expensive fossil fuels to activate them, be sides gobbling up thousands of acres of trees from our fragile wa tersheds. They range farther and farther across the steep mountain slopes in their insatiable greed. And the road required to support their excessive weight begin to resemble railroad grades. These roads mangle the forest system like dinosaur trails and will likely provide enough sediment to bury the trucks. May we look forward to fossilized logging trucks? They are no less at odds with their own habitat than the dinosaurs. They are too big for their own survival and too expensive. One fully For hauling cost about $60,000.  Add to that the licensing, permits and operating costs and we can see why lumber is being priced out of the market. And why mills depending upon logs from greater and greater distances are being shut down. Now, the timber industry is telling us they can reduce some of the environmental damage from logging trucks by using helicop ters in the steeper areas. We maintain this is still dinosaur think ing. How can a piece of equipment costing ten times as much as a logging truck harvest timber any more economically? Wouldn&#39;t they literally raise the lumber sky high? And they need the roads and trucks anyway to collect the logs at some central point. So we have seen the results of ancient evolution run amuck and modern technology run amuck. We can begin to evaluate the self defeating relationships between big appetites and small minds. Some things are just too big. We can&#39;t afford them. Maybe the industrialists should study paleontology.","Thank you very much.

The goal in  these hearings  will determine future management of unroaded lands in Idaho National Forest. The major controversy centers on whether or not these lands should be roaded for the pur pose of distracting timber from them. Most, if not all of the areas of the Payette National Forest that are being considered, simply     is to provide legislation that  cannot be logged economically. No matter what the outcome of these hearings, many of the lands in question will not be roaded and logged unless the Federal Government continues to subsidize the timber industry by building the roads and by selling the timber at less than the timber really costs economically. In my mind the public debate is beginning re garding the nature and extent of the subsidy in your hearings be ginning today. The public is going to soon decide whether it wants to continue to provide the subsidy. The determination of this issue, which I sus pect will be very hot politically, will be what determines whether these lands are roaded or not.

And I would like at the outset to thank you for the  opportunity to present my views to the committee and to Senator Symms. As a result of a large turnout for testimony here, I will try to be as brief as possible and address two single issues. The first is the inclusion of the White Clouds area to the national wilderness system. The second of all is the proposed release language in the Idaho wilderness. The White Clouds Mountains are of a specific concern to me be cause of my extensive personal experience in that area. In addition, their intimate proximity to the Sawtooth Wilderness Area makes their inclusion in the wilderness system particularly appropriate. Those who have hiked, fished, hunted or camped in these areas are no doubt aware of the outstanding potential for a wide range of outdoor activities. In addition, those who fish the Salmon River are aware of the effect of this important watershed on the production of many anadramous and fresh water fish. In addition to the objective value of this proposed area, it is also a symbol of the efforts of the people of Idaho to preserve wilderness areas for themselves and future gen erations. No doubt you&#39;re aware of the fight some years ago to preserve this area in the face of a proposal to operate certain mines. The comments of the people of Idaho stands of a symbol, not only of the efforts of these people to preserve wilderness, but their commit ment which has been politically expressed, I think in terms of that particular question. The desire of the people of this State to preserve substantial wil derness areas as evidenced by that political struggle and this desire continues to this day. Unfortunately, Senator, this inclusion of the so-called release language in any Idaho wilderness bill would act to  thwart these wishes.  Simply because Congress or any other body or agency has not had sufficient time or opportunity to complete a comprehensive study of the proposed wilderness area, both in terms of the aesthet ic value, biological values and the economic impacts is certainly not sufficient reason to open such an area to multiple use.",,NICHOLAS DIBERT,"BOISE, IDAHO",Dibert,Nickolas,h1d1,"dibert, nickolas",Boise (CITY); White Clouds (WILDERNESS); White Cloud Mountains (LANDFORM); Sawtooth Wilderness Area (WILDERNESS); Salmon River (STREAM),text

I&#39;d like to quote from one of their national publications and I think it&#39;s fair because the issue â€” publication is called Wilderness and it&#39;s the current issue. An ancient German law prescribed cap ital punishment for someone who wantonly peeled the bark of a living tree. The offender was condemned to have his navel cut out and nailed to the part of the tree he had mutilated and then he was driven around the tree until his intestines were wound around the trunk. His life thus replaced the violating skin of the tree. This heathen practice and worshipping of false gods and this socalled ancient German law were presented in this magazine as being good. Another article in the same magazine refers to the time of American&#39;s original productivity and abundance as the dark ages. They simply put darkness for light. One graduate of the wilderness society has founded the organiza tion called Earth First and is quoted as saying it should be a pio neering a revolution Questioning the very philosophical tenets of our Western civilization. Gentlemen, whether we like it or not, these misguided extremists are engaged in what they consider a holy war.

I support the concept of protect ing the wilderness areas in Idaho through national legislation, for these areas belong to and benefit not only the residents of this State, but all Americans. I believe in preparing this legislation, you and the Congress must consider the feelings not only of the trade and industry groups, but of private citizens such as have testified today, who know and use and love the areas being considered for inclusion in the bill. To fail to consider the wishes of the public is to deprive them of access to and use of the resources which are owned and managed for the benefit of all Americans. I believe the Congress has a moral obligation to search out and protect from exploitation and ruin all wilderness areas. I support the so-called Idaho core of areas as well as any other areas which may come to the attention of the committee through a variety of sources.  I would urge secondly, that any proposed legislation keep the door open for areas not now designated wilderness, so that they might be designated wilderness at a later time. I believe we should try to avoid imposing on future generations decisions which are made in this generation and I will urge you that the language of the current laws be included in any new legislation that you might draft. In an era of tight Federal budgets and growing deficits, I strong ly object to the subsidy the Government gives to the timber indus try so that these companies can harvest timber from public lands.

I support wilderness designation for a number of proposed wil derness in the State of Idaho. There are in particular two which I would address today. The first is Lime Creek, located in the Sawtooth National Forest, among the Soldier Mountains, north of Fairfield and the other is the Needles, located east of Cascade in the Payette National Forest. I have backpacked, horsepacked, hiked, fished and hunted both of these areas extensively over the last several years. Because our family farm is located in the Fairfield area, I have spent a large amount of time in the Lime Creek proposed wilder ness study area. I would characterize it as having considerable qualities of remoteness and giving one the feeling of solitude. I would also point out that it is located in an area where forest regeneration is a slow process at best. There are a number of old cuts in the vicinity which show little evidence of any regrowth whatsoever. I would be happy to show them to you some time. Insofar as the Needles are concerned, it is an area, I&#39;m sure you are aware, is located along the drainage of the South Fork of the Salmon River. I am certain you know that past logging road build ing practices in that vicinity have led to some disastrous siltation problems insofar as the river fishery is concerned. I would think that it would be highly appropriate for the Nee dles, given their spectacular beauty, to be designated anything other than wilderness. Because it appears logging and a sound en vironmental manner is practically impossible under any circum stances in that area, wilderness designation also makes sense.

I have looked at this question for some time, and I do support the conservationists and sportsmen, the land for saving part of the re maining wilderness, about 50 percent of it. I have tussled with this question for some time now. I was at a meeting and talked to some people that had a report from the Idaho timber industry, and showed that they were, according to their report, they needed to have a 20 percent of the annual pro duction need of these forest lands, according to this recent report, the Idaho timber industry. I wondered why that was true, because as far as I understood, the land they were cutting on now should be in a sustained yield, and they shouldn&#39;t need anymore land to continue their operation, but that they needed it for maintenance to keep up their operation. I talked to some other people here in the State of Idaho involving timber resource, and they pointed out that what had happened is that the allowable cut for a very large area, let&#39;s say a national forest, was used as a guide when the only real accessible parts of that area were cut on. So in other words, we had an allowable cut for a large area that was cut on a smaller portion of that, so they were overcutting because of those errors in preplanting both by the industy and the Forest Service. So by those previous mistakes, we are expected to let them go ahead and take some more wilderness to continue their operations. I feel that&#39;s a mistake, because we have already been mistaken, and cut too much on land that was already accessible to them. Why allow them more land to cut and continue that mistake? It seems to me that we should recognize the problem, the indus try does have a problem, but this wilderness that does exist now does not create the unemployment we have, and releasing of that would not help the unemployment problem.

Thank you, Senator McClure and Senator Symms. I have visited several of the proposed wilderness areas, including Borah Peak, Little Wood River, and the Ten Mile area in the Boise National Forest. These visits brought me great pleasure, and I strongly recommend wilderness designation for all these areas. That being said, I would like to make some general comments today from the standpoint of a taxpaying citizen. As a taxpayer, I see the building of roads in national forests as an unwelcome financial burden. The costs should be shifted to the users whenever possible, and the costs to the Treasury should be kept to a minimum, especially in terms of huge Federal budget deficits. Up to now, you want to use the national forests as a timber in dustry. Up to now, the timber companies have been able to per suade the taxpayer that it pays to build roads, since the timber sales cover the costs of the roads and add dollars to the Treasury. But lately, the figures show that the Forest Service roads built with public dollars cost more than the timber companies paid for the lumber removed. As a taxpayer, I am not interested in subsidizing the timber in dustry, nor do I want to lock timber companies out of areas in the national forests which would be profitable to them and to the Fed eral Government. Therefore, I suggest that the Forest Service study all the roadless areas to determine the density and quality of the timber stands, and how much it would cost to build a road to harvest each stand. Then the timber companies will determine if they can absorb the entire cost of building roads, and still make a profit selling the logs.  If they can, then the area should be released to development. If they cannot, then the area should remain wilderness. In many Idaho roadless areas, the costs of building roads is so high that it probably would be cheaper to harvest logs by helicop ter.  I am also a wilderness advocate as well as a taxpayer, and I would like to close with a poem whispered to be by my good friend Doug Fir If only you knew! About forests you haven&#39;t a clue.

I am a recent  graduate from the college of Idaho. I am here today to testify as a native Idahoan addressing the issue of proposed wilderness in Idaho. I believe wilderness is very important to Idaho and the country. I have traveled quite extensively throughout my life through the United States. I know that Idaho is very beautiful and unique. I acknowledge that one of the best experiences in anyone&#39;s life can be enjoyed within wilderness areas. These areas are so beauti ful and solemn compared to industry ladened towns and cities. I really enjoy backpacking. I just think it is beautiful up there in the wilderness. For the above-stated reasons, I fully endorse and support the en dangered Idaho wilderness core. These 10 areas will help to pre serve Idaho&#39;s beauty, wildlife, and natural heritage. I also support no hard release, but soft release language be used in the upcoming Senate bill. This I would like to endorse to insure open consideration of wilderness in the future. I would like to add that I am aware that lumber, oil, and mining are important industries to Idaho and Idahoans. However, I believe the 10 areas included in the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core are a gracious compromose to Idaho. Thus giving both the industries adequate use of the land while at the same time preserving the land for the future through wilderness. Thank you.","Thank you.
Senator Symms?
Senator Symms. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I will say
again that I certainly appreciate your â€” and I think I am speaking
for everyone in the room here â€” appreciate your patience in allow
ing everyone here to testify.
I might make one comment for those that are remaining here
that with respect to the hard release language that I think we all
should recognize that in the year 2000, or 1990, 2010, whatever,
Congress will always, under our constitutional system, be able to
take another look at what has been done in the past, so I think
that those who fear that somehow hard release language is in any
way going to ever interfere with the ultimate decision heing made

556

in the future, those things that happen 50 years from now, I am
not sure we could control that today, and put anything in the law
that will make the kind of protection that many of you would like.
Congress can always go back, reopen the question, and redo it.
There is not much we can do about that as we won&#39;t be here to
deal with Congress when that happens anyway 100 years from




now.

But I would just make one other comment, and I think it is
worthy to make comment. Dave Simmonds, I appreciate your testi
mony when you make a statement, and I appreciate your idealism
and your enthusiasm, but when you make a statement as you did,
this is &#39;in large part responsible for the advanced state of decay of
the global environment and the decline of the uality of life in gen
eral, and humanity in particular,&#39; I think that is just a little bit of
an overstatement. I think we should, at least, from my point of
view, I think we ought to at least pay a little bit of respect to those
people that built this country before us. I know I have never lived
m a house, and probably most of the people in this room have
never lived in a house that didn&#39;t have the amenities of hot and
cold running water, and electricity for any long period of time,
other than the times when I was in the field or in the back coun
try, but the field, in particular. But when I talked to my father
about this, he was 28 years old, he is 83 now, but before he lived in
a house with electricity or plumbing, he says that if he has the
choice, he prefers the way it is now than the way it was prior to
the times when he lived in that kind of a house.
I think that sometimes that if you look around this beautiful
Boise Valley, it may not be perfect, and it may not have been de
veloped in a perfect fashion, but in terms of what it was like 100
years ago, we are certainly able to provide a greater opportunity
for more human beings to live a comfortable pleasant life and
enjoy the pursuits of their own destiny and their own interests
today than they were 100 years ago, after the development. So I
don&#39;t think we should sell ourselves so short.
The environmental movement certainly has been largely success
ful in this country in terms of the water quality, the air quality,
and other things. We have made enormous strides in the United
States in the last 25 years toward having a cleaner and better envi
ronment. I don&#39;t think we should sell ourselves so short.
I think we should recognize, and of course it is not perfect, but a
great many improvements have been made, and there has to be
some kind of a balance on this question. That&#39;s what we are trying
to get at with this committee.
I know that the chairman of the committee has a big responsibil
ity to try to put consideration to all of these interests that are rec
ommended,
but those interests that you talk about of timber,
mining, and other, those are people interests. Those are also the in
terests of lives of human beings. They are trying like everyone else
to be able to make a living and raise their families, and enjoy their
own pursuits. I think that we have to make considerations of what
those aspects are.
Another aspect that hasn&#39;t been mentioned today that I think,
Mr. Chairman, for our record, it should be mentioned that what is
going on right now in the world, in the Middle East, there is no




557

question that the Soviets are making every effort to move into Af
ghanistan, to move toward that Persian Gulf. I would not be at all
surprised that sometime in the next 2 or 3 years that we see them
make an adventure to try to secure warm water ports in the Per
sian Gulf, which would certainly jeopardize oil supplies with the re
maining western world.
The move in Africa right now by Qaddafi moving southward is
obviously a part of a concerted effort of the Soviets, the Cubans,
and others in Central Africa to try to cut a division between Africa
for world resources for petroleum, cobalt, other things that are es
sential in our society.
We see it happening, and yet we continue to move toward bigger
and larger and more wilderness area. I think there has to be a con
sideration from an environment standpoint.
I would prefer to see the young people in the United States by
working to use highly sophisticated technological advancements of
what should we extract from precious minerals from the soil in a
minimum degradation to the environment than I would see them
carrying M-16 rifles in Africa or in the Middle East trying to fight
for those same precious resources that are in other areas. I thing
that those are considerations that you, Mr. Chairman, are going to
have to consider when this markup comes up before the Senate
Energy Committee, which most likely will later in this session of
Congress. I certainly will give you my encouragement and support
to try to reach some kind of a happy meeting ground and tradeoffs,
and a reasonable understanding, but I do think that point of view
from a long-term national security aspect has to be consideration of
all of our considerations.
Now, here in Idaho, maybe a few more thousand acres can be put
into wilderness, but when one looks at what has happened in the
last 10-year period in Congress; for example, what happened in
Alaska where we have an area in Alaska larger than the State of
California virtually set aside and precluded from the exploration
and extraction of precious minerals and energy, I think we have to
consider all those things, and those are factors that those of us
here need to be made aware of. There is a large, large amount of
land in the United States already set aside and put off limit.
I know of no other country in the world that has been able to
enjoy the luxury of absolutely inflexible terms in removing those
resource potential opportunities that their people may have to
have for the basic survival of the human race, and to just remove
them and make them off limit, and then be able to survive.
So I think that those are considerations that all of us here need
to recognize. These are factors that are going to be considered also,
and I think it probably should be considered also in determining
some kind of conclusion. Thank you.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Symms.
Might I say to this panel, I appreciate the fact that you wanted
to testify badly enough to come back to the end of the day when
you missed your panel earlier, and we will give you the opportuni
ty to do that.
Mr. Braun, you brought up a matter that has not mentioned by
others today, and that is what your definition of wilderness is. I
think that is particularly significant, because your definition of wil

558

derness touches on some things that are very much under discus
sion. The question of whether or not to spray trees to combat tree
diseases or combat destructive insects.
The tendency today is not to do that as that is part of the natu
ral ecosystem, and that we should not interfere with that.
The firefighting; again, I question upon which the public needs to
have some understanding and give us insight as to their feeling
concerning that management option.
Tree planting, I think in almost every instance is prohibitive in
wilderness areas.
Winter feeding of deer, elk, and moose when they are stranded
or endangered is again probably right squarely astride a manage
ment option with conflicts as to how that should be done in wilder

Sometimes that thought becomes a state prerogative, because the
state manages the fish and game species, and that it is none of the
Federal Government&#39;s business. Other times when it has been des
ignated as wilderness, the Federal Government will say we have
decided to go do that there, even though you have the responsibil
ity for fish and game, resident species, you can&#39;t do it in the wilder
ness area, those are all part of a debate going on.
I appreciate the fact that you addressed that.

Mr. Braun. May I comment?
The Chairman. Certainly.
Mr. Braun. I wanted to read that out loud, but the time limit
didn&#39;t allow that.
Also, when I presented this definition of wilderness, maybe provi
sions might have to be made to allow a second type of wilderness
which no one has brought up when I was here. Especially, reading
this definition of allowing other uses, which some wilderness areas
cannot have, like tree planting or stopping tree disease, if this
can&#39;t be done, maybe we have to decide on a second type of wilder
ness.

it,

The Chairman. That&#39;s been discussed from time to time. I am
sure it will be discussed more in the future.
Mr. Braun. Also, I think Senator Symms was very wise in what
he said about other countries in what they are doing toward re
sources. We have lost a good mine in northern Idaho. The men
wanted to work, but certain people back in I believe Pittsburg, I
hate to say the word union, but they wouldn&#39;t let them work. I be
lieve a lot of our titanium comes from that mine, and that goes to
wards jet fighter aircrafts. Without that mineral, the only other
place it can come from is South Africa, and other places in Africa.
If some of these minerals can&#39;t be mined, we will have a loss of
national security. Some of these areas might have to be put into
mining, or allow it for future use. Maybe not all of it has to be
stuck into wilderness, but maybe a good portion of
or just half of
it, but there are other uses.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.

opportunity to testify. have no further questions of the panel, and

I feel that we do need more wilderness in Idaho, and that it is very vital to the state and people of the state. I do not support hard release language in your bill, and would urge you to try and utilize soft release type language. I feel that wilderness is consistent with the development by the State Fish and Game in trying to reestablish anadromous fish in this State. We have invested a great deal of money not only in this State, but in others in building hatcheries and facilities to manage these fish. The reasons have been because of the dams on the rivers and the siltation caused by the roads in the forest for tim bering. We need to stop this right now, and get on with reestablishing these runs. Wilderness is also important to watersheds and water quality. Water quality is important, because if the water quality of this State is degraded further, the people in this State can only count on spending more money in treating that water for their needs in the future. I am disturbed with the economics of the timber industry if it is true that it costs more to build these roads than to harvest the timber, then we have created a false economy, and it will not be wilderness which destroys the timber industry.

Thank you, Senator. I appreciate this opportunity to speak on some of the areas I&#39;m familiar with in eastern Idaho, and I&#39;m speaking as an individual. In 1978 the Fish and Wildlife Service started a program which at that point was called the unit  760  wildlife equal systems program which was seking to identify unusu al habitat areas in Idaho, areas with very high wildlife value for sensitive, endangered, or otherwise valuable species. The type of range cited, which are identified, was the south fork of the Snake River from Conda Valley to Heise. A large portion of that ecosys tem is included in the Garns Mountain Roadless Areas. This par ticular reach of the Snake in the tributary streams such as Burns Creek, which flows into it, support more than 20 State wildlife spe     cies concerned, including a number of own-growth-depending spe cies such as the wolverine, meadowlark, and others that are very sensitive to disturbance. This area also provides wintering habitat for between 800 and 2,600 elk, deer, and moose. It&#39;s a vital wildlife paradise, and I  would urge you to include it in the wilderness bill. I would also point out that this is the site of proposed Grangeville Two timber sale, in which the receipts of the timber sale would bring $20,000 to the Treasury, and yet road costs will be over $281,000. Even when you consider the entire package of other entries into this area, the Targhee National Forest is still estimated that you will get a return of 45 cents for each dollar spent in the timber sales program. Another area that I would like to support exclusively in your wil derness bill is the entire Lost River Range, Borah Peak, the Pahsimeroi, King Mountain, and Jump Off, this is a very rugged, very beautiful range with very low timber and mineral value. I would also urge that you include the entire ecosystem in this area when you draw your boundaries. I have here a photo I&#39;d like to show you. This is of Borah Peak; the BLM land that Secretary Watt dropped from the wilderness consideration last December makes up about the lower half of this picture. As you can see, there are species of wildlife which start up on the wilderness on the side of the hill and continue down all the way down to the BLM wilderness study area. I would urge you to include that in there. It has very little contrast, but high wildlife value. I&#39;ll give this picture to you. Another area I would like to see included would be the Diamond Peak Area, which is in the southern part of the Lemhi Range. This is much like the northern Lemhis; it is a little dryer, a little less timber value, but very good for supporting bighorn sheep and other  wildlife species.  I would urge you to include the Black Canyon Area as part of the entire ecosystem. I also urge protection for pioneers on the Challis Forest, and in the Sawtooths. Again, this is a very rugged scenic area without standing fisher ies and other values. And I would further urge you to include on that the Little Wood River, BLM wilderness study area, that was also dropped by Secretary Watt last December because of its small size. I would, for the record, also like to recommend the Lost River Range. Thank you.","Thank you. We will place the photographs in the

Senator McClure, thank you for taking the time to call this  meeting for the opinions to be expressed by all groups.  In particular, the one thing that I read in some of the newspaper  articles concerned the declining of the basic industries. And I  wanted to take issue with that.  In particular, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re well aware, the Russian economist, Kondratiev, predicted that once every 50 years there would  be an economic turndown or breakdown or whatever you&#39;d like to  call it. And the United States has seen those in 1837, 1893, of  course, in 1929, and now the most recent one. My point is that the  industries that provide excellent jobs and excellent wages for the  working man shouldn&#39;t be penalized just because they&#39;re making a  profit. And I feel very strongly about that. I have no objection that  the timber industry goes in and cuts down a tree. I don&#39;t expect a  mess to be left behind. But to me it&#39;s very important that those of  us who have to go out and work for a living can find an employer  that&#39;s willing to pay a decent wage.  I&#39;d like to site some specific examples of Superior Mining, a division of Superior Oil from Houston, Tex. They went into the Yellow  Pine Mining District. And they took a town that was dead broke,  flat out busted, and they&#39;ve turned it into a town that now has at     least a decent standard of living. It isn&#39;t great, but it&#39;s a whole lot  better than only a few backpackers and a few guides could provide.  The wilderness is great, but it doesn&#39;t provide enough jobs that pay  well for the working man. I really feel that&#39;s important.  You know, the rest of us have aspirations to build a life for ourselves, to have timber to build our homes out of. Nobody that I  know of wants rape and plunder or any of the things that went on  a half century ago. We want sound management, but we don&#39;t  want to be locked out of our own land.

Hello Senator McClure. Thank you for hold ing these hearings. My name is Tom Pomeroy and I&#39;m a member and a spokesperson for the Groundwater Alliance in Blaine  County, Idaho. I, like many members in the Groundwater Alliance, moved to Idaho because of the vast amount of unspoiled, unroaded land available to us. In my 10 years of living here, I have seen much of our beautiful State and have explored many beautiful areas. The differences be tween today, August 9, and my first backcountry trips in 1974 is amazing. More people, more pressures, and more tourist&#39;s dollars make a wilderness experience that is much harder to find. The very reasons we moved to Idaho are more important than ever now. Today we are here to speak up for what we like and love about living in Idaho. To the members of the Groundwater Alliance that means saving and protecting our public, unroaded lands. We are being forced constantly to compromise and give up acre after acre of our unroaded lands to commercial interests. We all know the immense value of our high quality environment, so why now are you, Senator McClure, hurrying to make these hard re lease decisions? We ask you as citizens and taxpaying members of the State, to include every possible acre remaining in Idaho to the national wil derness system, or to carefully study these lands before releasing them for private profit. Of particular interest to our group in Blaine County is our own public backyard. The White Clouds, the Boulders, the Pioneers, are all places close to our population centers. The Payette Crest, the Lemhi Range, Borah Peak, and the Lost River Range are all areas that bring tourists to our county. We urge you to make your decisions thinking in the context of time and to protect our public wild roadless lands for our future.

Good afternoon Senator McClure, Congressman Craig. My name is Jeffrey S. Bailey, from Blaine County. I come to  you advocating the proposed wilderness areas of the State. I believe that these areas should remain untouched and should retain their wild characteristics. I urge you to include the endangered Idaho wilderness core. These designated areas should not have their ecosystems and quali ties tampered with. The erosion from these proposed roads would hurt the delicate fish populations and their abilities to spawn. These roads would also hamper the mobility of game and the endangered species.  395     I would also like you to strike the hard release language from your bill. I support the soft release of wilderness. These roadless  lands should be studied again during the next forest planning cycle. One point I would like to stress is that as a country we are slowly amending our ways since the Industrial Revolution. During that time we realized that it would take years to bring back the sacred earth. We saw that we needed parks for recreation, appreciation and preservation of wildlife. This was the reason for the Yellowstone Park in the late 19th century. It was the first of its kind. The Wilderness Act of 1964 was another step forward. We saw that man and his technology was beginning to roll through his fragile ecosystem. We should continue to follow in these footsteps. We should not turn back our progress, but be looked upon as a caring generation who had the foresight to protect something that we have enjoyed and to preserve the lands for future generations. Thank you.","Thank you very much. I would just, in consult
ing the staff, because I&#39;m trying to discern something that runs
through a number of statements here today, and Mr. Bailey, you
said it more explicitly than anyone else has. That&#39;s the reason I re
sponded perhaps a little bit more to it.
You say I would like to see you strike the hard release language
from your bill. I don&#39;t have a bill. I wonder what you&#39;re referring
to. I&#39;m puzzled by it.
If you&#39;re saying please don&#39;t put it in a bill, I would understand
that. But apparently somebody has put forth the notion that I have
a bill and that it says something that I don&#39;t know.
Mr. Bailey. How about a proposal?
The Chairman. I made no proposal.
Mr. Bailey. That&#39;s good.
Mr. Pomeroy. Good.
The Chairman. The reason I mention it is because apparently a
great many people have seen or heard something about something

Thank you, Senator. The content of my testimony is concerned mainly with those proposed wilderness areas in eastern Idaho. However, I would like to express my support for wilderness designation for the areas outlined in the Idaho Wildlife Federa tion s Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core. These 10 areas represent high quality lands that are critical to wildlife, stream quality, fish eries, and wilderness recreation. Specific areas in this region in eastern Idaho in which I support wilderness classification include the Italian Peaks, Diamond Peak, Borah Peak, the Pahsimeroi, Palisades, and Garn Mountain, Worm     742  Creek, Mount Naomi, West Mink Creek, the Pioneer Mountains, and the Boulder/White Clouds area. Most of these areas possess critical wildlife habitat. Also, those areas within the Caribou and Targhee National Forests are very accessible to the greater part of the population in southeast Idaho. The areas proposed by the proposal, I think it was, No. 4 in the Wildlife Federation, it&#39;s about 4Va million acres, is a poor economic potential for timber production. Much of the land, especially areas such as the Pioneers, Bolder/White Clouds, Borah Peak, and the Lemhis, have poor access, slow regeneration, easily erodible soils, and thin distribution of trees. The impact of logging such areas is demonstrated 2 years back on the South Fork of the Salmon River when it was open to timber harvest. They simply ruined the South Fork for salmon when they go into the spawning grounds. We keeps hearing today that the timber industry is opposed to wilderness classification because of decreasing job opportunities and threatens stability. Currently, nationwide, there is approxi mately a 40 billion board feet backlog of timber, with approximate ly a 1 billion board feet backlog in Idaho alone. Also, most of the extra timber is sent to Japan. Also, the Northwest&#39;s timber indus try cannot compete with the Southwest&#39;s timber industry without the current Federal subsidy. These subsidies, essentially, amount to the payment by the Forest Service for the construction of all access roads. A recent study by the National Resources Defense Council outlined that the Caribou, Challis, Salmon, Sawtooth, and Targhee National Forests consistently lost money in timber sales. For example, the Caribou National Forest only returned 24 cents for each dollar spent on timber sales. The Sawtooth National Forest had a 26-cent return on the dollar. This situation will not improve due to recent changes in the national forest policy that allows companies more liberal de ductions for road construction; that is, road credits. Most of the areas identified in the Idaho Wildlife Federation&#39;s wilderness pro posal cannot be logged economically because of this. The second areas I would like to address concerns release lan guage. Information that I have read indicates that you favor a hard release language. And what I understand this means is that wilder ness that is not classified would never have the chance to be con sidered in the future. I oppose this type of language in any Idaho wilderness bill and instead favor soft release language. This would allow those areas still roadless during the next planning cycle, 15 years from now, to be reevaluated. In summary, I would like to say that I support the Idaho Wildlife Federation&#39;s wilderness proposal, with emphasis on those areas identified in the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core. We oppose hard release language for those areas not designated wilderness. Those areas in eastern Idaho previously mentioned should be desig nated as wilderness. I feel that this is especially critical with the recent announce ment that you made from your office that the Idaho National Energy Laboratory is the initial choice for the location of the new production reactor. This is going to result in a boom-type atmos phere in this part of the country, and all I can say is it&#39;s more dev astation to the wildlife area.  743     And I have one more question to ask you, Senator. I called you office three times in the past 2 weeks trying to get a copy of your proposal, the letter/questionnaire that you sent out. I had two friends of mine call three times, and I never got them.","I don&#39;t have those as of yet.

The Chairman. When there is one, they will be out.

Mr. Case. Is there any way I can get a copy of the procedure you
use?

The Chairman. Sure. I&#39;m not sure about the procedure.
Mr. Case. Well, I&#39;d just like to see how you got it. I&#39;m on the

Senator McClure, I am testifying today on the Saw tooth completion, the roadless areas adjoining the existing Saw tooth Wilderness on the south and west. This is a scenically beauti ful area. The Sawtooths have a number of rugged peaks over 10,000 feet high. And Steel Mountain and other peaks on the western flanks of the Sawtooths are outstanding. All the areas in the com pletion have high wildlife values supporting deer, elk, black bear, bobcat and a host of other wildlife species. The Sawtooth completion is located close to both Boise and the Wood River Valley areas with high demand for recreation. Addi tion to the completion would relieve hiking and other recreational pressure on the Sawtooths, an area currently overcrowded. This would both expand recreational opportunities in the Sawtooths, and by dispersing recreational use, improve the quality of the expe rience for all users. The Sawtooth National Forest has constantly lost money in its timber sales program in the last decade. According to a National Resources Defense Council study, during the period from 1974 to 1978, the Sawtooth returned 26 cents to the Treasury for each dollar spent on timber sales. This is a drain on the economy, and contributes to our national deficit. Designation of the Sawtooth completion will slow the economic drain, as well as providing a positive economic asset to southwest ern Idaho. Thank you for this opportunity.","Thank you.

My name is Robin Jenkins, and I repre sent C&amp;B Timber Products in Ashton, Idaho. Our company is en  gaged in logging and production of other timber-related products. We do have some questions and concerns on the issue of more wilderness area. We have these questions, first as a company, sec ondly as part of the timber industry as a whole, and third, and probably the most important, as citizens who love the forest lands. How many people can actually use and enjoy wilderness? How many more people could enjoy the beauty of this area if they could take a vehicle into these areas? What about the elderly, the young, and the disabled? Is it really fair to shut these people out simply because they cannot hike or ride horses in? We who work in the timber industry love the forest lands as much as or more than anyone else. Not only do the forest lands put the bread and butter on our tables, but it is also our playground, year round. We want it managed in such a way that our forest lands will be there for generations to come, for everyone to utilize and enjoy. How many of you have homes built with wood products of some kind, The initial cost of a home is our of reach for some people now. How much more expensive will these wood products and ma terials be when the timber industry starts having difficulty obtain  ing the raw material? How many people have woodburning stoves, fireplaces, or fur naces as their main source of heat? How many of these people would be hard pressed to pay an ever-increasing utility bill if they couldn&#39;t use wood to help heat their homes? It will become harder and harded to find or obtain firewood as the forest areas are eaten up by wilderness areas The wilderness proposals will very slowly and quietly begin to squeeze the logging industry. It will become more and more diffi cult to find the raw material. As the industry feels the pinch, they will layoff workers. This will have a trickle-down effect on other industries that use the loggers&#39; product, such as the building indus  722  try, mines, and paper companies. Their products would be more ex pensive, and would be produced by fewer people. High unemploy ment for long periods would add to the food stamp line and the crowd in the welfare office. The logging industry pays, and pays dearly, for the timber they harvest. That money, in turn, is put into reforestation and conser vation projects to insure that we will have forests in the future. Much of eastern Idaho&#39;s timber harvest is made into 2 by 4&#39;s without which the building industry would slump. The remaining timber goes into dry lumber products, chips for fuel, and paper and plain old garden-variety firewood. The timber industry is, in effect, the beginning of a chain that grows and branches, supplying many other industries and employing many people. We are very definitely against any further wilderness proposals as they would benefit very few people for recreation or for busi ness.  Thank you.","Thank you Mr. Tolman, you got here just

Aug-09-1983,aug-09-1983-craig-hon-larry-e,elected official,,"Craig, Hon. Larry E.",a U.S. Representative from the State of Idaho,,,m,"Thank you very much, Jim. And let me ask unanimous consent that the entirety of my text be inserted in the record. The issue under discussion today involves more than just how  much land is needed for wilderness. Idaho&#39;s public lands are used for timber harvest, grazing, mining, recreation, agriculture, and support of schools, maintenance of roads, the construction of homes and related support industries. These lands involve thousands of lives, the lifestyle of Idahoans, and an essential tax base for our es sential services. Senator, in considering wilderness, additional wilderness, for Idaho there are several important things that I think need to be discussed besides the issue of wilderness itself.  As Senator Symms has mentioned, Idaho is on record as being the second State in the Nation to recognize the importance of wilderness and as a result of that has placed nearly 3.8 million acres into wilderness. Along with the importance that we have placed on wilderness, I think it is the importance of utilizing Idaho&#39;s land base as has been felt in the last recession. One of the many resources of funds for the State and public land counties is the Forest Reserve Fund. This fund is derived by the sale of timber from the Forest Service and funds later distributed to counties, not only for wilderness, but for schools and school maintenance. This fund plays a critical role in many of the counties of our State. The Mineral Royalty Fund is a very important source of revenue to Idaho. As the recession has hit the mining industry, some mines have been forced to close but mining still plays a very important economic role in our State. A conservative multiplier of impact in terms of jobs supportive to the mining industry is about 2.5. In other words, approximately 25 to 30 thousand people in Idaho are directly or indirectly employed because of mining activities, primarily on the public lands of our State. These numbers will increase substantially in the future if we do not close the door to the opportunity to mine. The importance of keeping land open for grazing is well known. The livestock industry uses public land to graze in Idaho. And in conjunction with the private lands, this relationship is clearly needed for our present industry and for the future industry. All and all, the issue of wilderness and the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation has been going on for at least 12 years, Senator. The first RARE I was started in 1970. RARE II was initiated in 1977. And of course, we are attempting with these hearings and with the efforts of wilderness legislation to bring this process to a conclusion. The people of Idaho deserve a reprieve from the indecisions and the confusion that have resulted in the past several years. If Idaho is to maintain an economic base strong enough to keep its young people from leaving its boundaries, then the question of wilderness in our State needs to be resolved. Many people are unwilling to discuss economics when the issue of wilderness comes up. But they are so intertwined, they must be viewed as inseparable. The livelihoods and lifestyles of generations of Idahoans are ultimately at stake. Whatever decision affecting Idaho&#39;s natural resources is made over the next several months, a proper balance between protecting pristine areas and allowing the economic development must be weighed evenly and fairly. Senator McClure, you must be commended for taking this forth right and steady position on the issue. Idaho is indeed fortunate to have Senator McClure as Chairman of the Natural Resource and Energy Committee in the U.S. Senate. His willingness to hold hear ings in Idaho and discuss this issue is reflective of his commitment to achieve a solution to the indecision and confusion that has sur rounded us for a good number of years.  5     The hearings and the input from Idahoans will be interesting and important and I look forward to working with the Idaho con gressional delegation in bringing a conclusion to this issue.

I have served on the national forest advisory board to the Secre tary of Agriculture and currently serve as chairman of the re sources and environment committee of the Idaho State Senate. It is my opinion that the citizens of our State prefer a moderate approach to additional wilderness. We have a strong tradition of responsible multiple use management and have invested heavily in forest and range management through our excellent College of For estry at the University of Idaho. We should recognize that nonwilderness designation, with lands remaining under the current form of Forest Service management does not imple desecration of wildlife and recreational values. Many of our finest lands have been logged and mined at some point in their history. Any legislation should provide for profession al Forest Service management of lands not designated wilderness while removing the uncertainties of future wilderness review. Re lease language should not allow a loosening of management strings which leads to destructive harvesting practices. Too many Forest Service resources have been tied up with count less review and planning exercises. Such repetitions only cut into practical on-the-ground management efforts which are critical to monitoring, sometimes policing, multiple use activities on Forest Service lands. I think Senator McClure is wise to move now to make decisions to avoid the flow of manpower and dollars into additional nonpro ductive efforts. Our people do desire some additional wilderness, but limited to those areas where multiple use management cannot protect recre ational, aesthetic, and wildlife values. Even those whose primary interest in the land is recreational are worried about the advertis ing effect of wilderness designation. I, for one, have full confidence in your ability, Senator McClure, to provide the direction for the future protection and management of our precious and magnificent lands.

My name is Gail Bray and I repre sent district 17 in the Idaho State Senate. I thank you for the early  opportunity to testify today. As a State Senator I have voted consistently in the interests of the environment and to protect the needs of commerce and indus try. I see a vital link between these interests, one which needs not be exclusionary. To that end, I strongly oppose the concept of hard re lease. It is an exclusionary provision which limits our options. On July 28, 1983, a conference on education and technological de velopment was hosted by Boise State University with some 100 in vited business, education, and political leaders of southwestern Idaho. The keynote speaker, Dr. Bruce Merrifield, Assistant Secretary for Productivity, Technology and Innovation in the U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, discussed the four major world forces of change which will catapult the world industries as we now know them beyond present day recognition. While all of those forces will impact upon Idaho&#39;s timber and mining industries, one of the major forces for change â€” that of the technology explosion â€”clearly indicates why the concept of hard re lease is unwise. Within the technological explosion, one of the focused growth areas is that of materials science, the discovery of substitutes for traditional materials: graphite epoxies, laminants, plastics, alloys. The example of a structure of reinforced mesh being submerged in saltwater is illustrative of the innovation which will expand out materials options. Upon applying a low voltage to the mesh, the saltwater solidifies as if concrete and almost laborless houses are created. While not my idea of a dream home, the cost of energy and desire for increased efficiency joined with technological advances may in fact render materials both beautiful and ultraefficient within the next few years. The best minds of the day are saying it is unwise to forecast the needs of the future based on the state of the art today. We must maintain our options. When one considers that 90 per cent of all scientific knowledge has been generated during the last 30 years and that scientific knowledge will double in the next 10 to 15 years, it is reasonable to anticipate new manmade materials for the majority of materials now derived from nature. I believe a hard release provision is very unlikely. Lands desig nated in the year 1983 or 1984 by Congress as nonwilderness should be reconsidered in 10 to 15 years for wilderness protection if the then-prevailing supply and demand and technological changes so merit reevaluation.  14  A legislatively  imposed hard release at this time of technological  fluidity solidifies unnecessarily our future options. I urge a soft re     lease approach.  Finally, your consideration of the Arizona strip wilderness bill as introduced in both the House and Senate of the U.S. Congress on July 13, 1983, is requested. As reported in the July 25, 1983 issue of the Christian Science Monitor, this legislation is: &#39;Sponsored by one of the most diverse casts of politicians ever to unite behind a piece of environmental legislation.&#39; Its sponsors in the Senate included Utah Senator Jack Gam and Arizona Senators Barry Goldwater and Dennis DeConcini. In the House, Morris Udall and Bob Stump were sponsors. Bob Stump is the lead sponsor and apparently has never before voted for a wil derness bill, let alone sponsored one. The legislation was produced through cooperation between the environmentalists and industry leaders. The value of negotiation in such a situation is the precedent it sets for solution of future con flict issues. Copies of the newspaper article are submitted for the record and your review. For Idaho to approach its wilderness determination similarly to that in Arizona would require more time than has been allowed under the present timetable.

I&#39;m not sure we have got ourselves quite organized     here.  Gentlemen, I&#39;m Larry Biasing. I&#39;m acting executive director for the Inland Forest Resource Council of Missoula, Mont. We are a timber industry association representing some of the companies in north Idaho. One of the objectives of both RARE I and RARE II was to allo cate the lands so that the public resource users would know what areas would be managed for their particular resource use. After 12 years, here we are requesting that Congress act to re solve that same issue. As a result of the California decision, the forest products indus try still does not have a defined resource base. Employees are un certain about their future. Companies&#39; access to financing is some times restricted. Building programs and equipment purchases are postponed and raw material prices have escalated due to a restrict ed supply. The whole issue of raw material uncertainty has led to an atmos phere of instability throughout the industry. Since the ninth circuit court of appeals rendered its decision, sev eral appeals have been filed against timber sales, access roads, and other development projects using that decision as the basis for com plaint. The Forest Service cannot operate effectively and efficiently in this ever-shifting morass of uncertainty. For this reason, it is abso lutely essential that Congress act to define the resource base that the various user groups can utilize. Congress must act to insure that all nonselected roadless areas be released from further consideration by the Forest Service for wilderness. The forest industries believe that this really should be a very long-term one, and, at a minimum, well beyond the year 2000. Any shorter release period will only perpetuate the uncertainty that now surrounds our commercial forest land base. Hard release is ab solutely essential to allow orderly development of national forest lands. We have seen several appeals in Montana and north Idaho that were based entirely or in part upon California RARE II decisions. In all cases, these appeals were to prevent development of some roadless area. Unless Congress specifically acts, this legal cloud  27  will continue     to haunt development of roadless areas that were studied under RARE II. The public has been asked to participate in the land allocation process on inventoried roadless areas since 1971 â€”",,LARRY B.

Locally, as well as state wide, the volume of national forest timber has been declining steadily. Obviously, we can&#39;t continue to operate as an industry.

We operate mainly on the Mountain Home district of the Boise National Forest and the Fairfield district of the Sawtooth National Forest. The program harvest of these two districts will just barely supply our necessary volume. In fact, the sawmill at Fairfield that had op erated almost 2 years was recently permanently closed down be cause a lack of supply of natural resource for a continued oper ation. Any more commercial forest land in our area placed in a nonharvest designation will definitely reduce the size of an already small sawmill or completely close them. The normal planning process of the Forest Service on our nation al forest already reduced this program harvest of timber for many other legitimate uses. Some of the reasons that I feel these programs should be final ized is we, being a small company, find it essential that we must know whether we have an opportunity to purchase timber on a long-range basis in order to â€” for long-term investment and to pro vide opportunities for stable employment which would attract good, essential people.

Senator McClure, Congressman Craig, I am Robert Coates representing Robert Hitchcock, president of Evergreen Forest Products. We use predominantly Federal timber in the manufacture of di mension lumber which comes from the Payette National Forest. Therefore, my remarks will be to the Payette National Forest. Timber harvesting on the Payette Forest has increased slowly over the years. We are reaching a peak of 113.3 million feet in fiscal year 1966. It has since than declined. And in 1971 it was down to 80 million, and since reduced even further. The downward trend in timber harvesting is a result of many dif ferent factors, including reductions in U.S. Forest Service timber sale preparation budgets, a decrease in timber demand with closure of the Boise Cascade mill at McCall, the quality of the timber sales offered by the Forest Service, and the recent recession.  57  It is interesting to note, however, that during the past 10 years, the Forest Service estimate of the potential yield has increased by 16 percent. Mr. Chairman, when Congress decides which, if any, roadless areas in southwestern Idaho should be added to the national Wil derness System, you should remember one key statistic: 40 percent of the productive forestland on the Payette Forest has already been set aside as wilderness. By comparison, only 13 percent of the entire National Forest System has been and 19 percent of all na tional forestland.

It is my contention that currently accessible areas could be brought up to much greater production levels through more effective management. The trees in the proposed wilderness areas have a greater value protecting our high mountain water sheds and for recreational and wildlife use. I am submitting to you a research article which has been publiched by the U.S. Forest Service in June of this year and based on studies on Idaho lands which demonstrates improved management techinques that increase production of merchantable timber on ex isting lightly managed young growth stands can produce as much as 100 percent more timber on those lands.1 It seems to me economically unreasonable to go the tremendous expense of building new roads into existing roadless areas when the areas that are already accessible could produce the lumber needed by Idaho industry.",,JULIE HALL,WOMEN IN TIMBER,Hall,Julie,h1d1,"hall, julie",Boise (CITY); the Boise National Forest (FOREST); Red Mountain (LANDFORM); Danskin Range (LANDFORM); Scott Mountain (LANDFORM),text

We bring no specific recommendations for wilderness areas to be included in your wilderness bill with the exception of Long Canyon and the White Cloud-Boulder Mountains.

We still think that an additional 2 to 3 months&#39; work in order to define area boundaries with great care to achieve the best possible recommen dations is not unreasonable. We are not trying to delay the process or confuse issues, areas, or boundaries. On the contrary, we are trying to make sure ample and adequate attention is given to the 6V2 million acres of roadless national forest land from which the wilderness areas in your bill    will  come.  The task of defining these areas and boundaries is enormous and cannot be properly accomplished in a hurry.

Personally, I can&#39;t divorce myself from this pristine wil derness environment. I believe it is unhealthy for society to do so as well. By using up that unroaded landscape we undermine what keeps our spirits free. We destroy the scale by which we measure progress. We muddy our American heritage.

Good morning, Senator, I am Walter C. Minnick. I am president of Trus Joist Corp., an international building materi als and wood products company headquartered in Boise. Our business is 100-percent dependent on the efficient use of our forestry resource. I make three points: First, despite what our paid affairs specialists may tell you, I and many employed in the uilding materials industry support substantially more wilderness. Eublic I personally favor adding another IV2 to 2 million acres to the State&#39;s wilderness system, which would divide the remaining wil derness area one-third for wilderness and two-thirds for multiple use. Second, multiple use should not mean just logging. In all multi ple-use areas we should insure that recreational interests, like biggame hunting, steelhead fishing, and snowmobiling, are not auto matically subordinated to cutting down trees. Where such uses are important economically, like Jersey Jack, we ought to create national recreation areas where logging will be  81     conducted only with no permanent roads in a fashion compatible with competing recreational uses. Third, you in Washington must do something, and do it now before the election, about runaway Federal budget deficits and the rising interest rates they are causing. My own company&#39;s order files have declined substantially in the last 30 days because you can&#39;t agree to balance the budget and do something about interest rates.

Thank you, Senator McClure and Congressman     Craig.  My name is Tom Robinson. I am regional director of The Wilder 85,000 members with approxi ness Society, a national group mately 400 members in Idaho. I would also like to add that I have a master&#39;s degree in forestry with emphasis on economics. I first would like to start off by dispelling the multiple use myth that wilderness is not multiple use. Wilderness is multiple use as determined by the Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act of 1980. Wilderness allows for four of the five multiple uses. That includes recreation, watershed, wildlife, and range. In fact, national forests were established with watersheds in mind, protection of watersheds. I would like to say that we do not oppose logging where the value of timber will support access in management costs, providing other resources can be protected. I would urge in this debate that you take a close look at the nature of each area. Basically what is its best use and that this analysis should include economic considerations. I feel that this issue is as much of an economic issue, this RARE II issue, as it is an environmental and wilderness preservation issue.  I would also like to say that just as conservationists should not claim every last acre should be protected in Idaho, industry should not use job scare tactics for every acre being considered. Studies have shown that the health of timber-dependent commu nities and the industries are more based on demand and not the availability of timber. In fact, our economic policy came in Wash ington just as it did a study on the California bill showing that in fact jobs will not be lost unless the market conditions are incred ibly harsh. I want to make one last point and that is concerning your re marks on hard release. As I understand it, national hard release language as it has been introduced in the past would require an act of Congress before lands could be considered for wilderness again. It would not be automatically part of the forest planning cycle. That&#39;s the difference that I see, unless you have a correction on that, and I would also just quickly add that basically if land had not been developed, land had not been recommended for wilder  85  ness, or should not be developed in 20 years, there&#39;s probably a very good reason why they weren&#39;t developed and that&#39;s probably because they are incredibly costly to access and they would require massive subsidies for road building.

I would like to start with the observation that the word &#39;conser vation&#39; and &#39;conservative&#39; spring from the same root. I think con servation is a conservative concept and wilderness is a conservative     cause.  Conservative recognizes the truth of the law of supply and demand and wilderness is a resource that is in an ever-decreasing supply and ever-increasing demand and will inevitably become ever more valuable. Conservative recognizes that all enterprises must live within their means. A household that violates this principle goes bank rupt. A government that violates this principle inevitably brings on raging inflation. An ecosystem that violates this principle and the management of an ecosystem violation of this principle will inevi tably exact a cost in the ecological quality of the land. A conservative takes the long-term view. A conservative respects the roots from which he or she has grown. Only in a wilderness, isolated from the works of our own making, can we truly understand and restore our relationship to the Earth and the power that created man as a part of it. A conservative knows that it is a poor bargain to trade an irre placeable capital asset for a short-term gain no matter how worthy that short-term gain is. A conservative does not make hasty decisions affecting funda mental resources. The Sierra Club is not now prepared to make boundary or acre age recommendations.

I&#39;m here today to submit testimony on behalf of the federation and myself and also to submit written tes timony of my wife and ask that it be made part of the record. The Idaho Wildlife Federation advocates and actively seeks the establishment within the National Wilderness Preservation System all lands identified for inclusion and management as wilderness within the scope and intent of the Wilderness Act. IWF likewise advocates and insists upon the comprehensive study of all such lands having those qualities and attributes as to render them candidates for inclusion within the Wilderness Preser vation System with determination made as to their designation prior to any activity that would impair or destroy such inherent qualities or attributes. Thus we come to the some 6V2 million acres of Idaho&#39;s wilderness areas and ask: Which, if any, of these roadless areas should be clas sified wilderness? The guiding principle in answer to this question must be: All such roadless areas whose basic resources of soil and water togeth er with their dependent life forms of fish, game, and nongame wild life, plants, or other intrinsic and scenic values are best protected and managed as wilderness. Timber mining of submarginal lands, deficit timber sales, or other shortsighted exploitation of inherent resources must be rec ognized and disposed in the public&#39;s interest. rWF opposes hard release language in any legislative proposal. We simply do not know all the answers at this time. Soft release is more appropriate and gives opportunity for fur ther study and classification at some future date. We are also opposed to the purist concept as regards manage ment of wilderness areas and would welcome the opportunity in working on legislative language to overcome this problem. Thank you for this opportunity to make comment. I trust you will consider well the matter of commercial forest lands, submar ginal forest lands, and deficit timber sales as identified and dis cussed in my written comments, water and watershed values, fish and wildlife habitat and values, and the host of other values that accrue to the public in drafting your proposed Idaho wilderness bill.

Thank you, Senator McClure, Senator Symms,  and Representative Craig for this opportunity to testify. My name is Andy Anderson and I represent the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation. The farm bureau is the largest farm organiza tion in the State, representing 22,000 families throughout Idaho. The position of the Idaho Farm Bureau has been and will remain that we are opposed to any additional wilderness designation in the State of Idaho. We feel that 3.8 million acres, which is more than any other State except Alaska, is far too much land to be locked up. When this 3.8 million acres was set aside, there was language in the legislation that called for the Government to explore and cata log the mineral resources of the area. This has not as yet been done. No more should be locked up at least until the resources have been cataloged. It is interesting to note that as the Forest Service has had to stop timber sales and mining activities in road less areas, that the revenue from the sale of minerals and timber back to the State and local units of government has fallen. Many counties in Idaho are made up of mostly Federal lands and they depend very heavily on the revenue generated by the sale of timber and minerals to support their schools and roads.  150  Agriculture is one of the largest taxpaying groups in the State and, as such, is very concerned with the prospect of seeing these lands locked by wilderness designation.  If  the Federal  funds to local units of government, especially     schools, continues to drop, an already shaky agricultural economy will be further taxed to make up the problems faced by farmers  and ranchers. There is a lot of talk by the proponents of wilderness that wilder ness is good for the tourists and recreational industry. The number of people speaking and participating in a wilderness recreational experience are a very numerically small part of the recreating public. Thus only a small part of the tourist trade. If Idaho is to have a strong tourist trade, it will need to develop more opportunities for the vast majority of people who need and want campgrounds that they have motorized access to. In conclusion, Senator, the local areas and the State of Idaho, as well as the Nation, cannot afford to lock up land and not develop and use the natural resources contained thereon. By locking up the land so it might be used by a very small part of the population you are denying the rest of the society access to these lands as well as removing from the land manage ment agencies the ability to do just that: manage.",,ANDY ANDERSON,"IDAHO FARM BUREAU, FEDERATION",Anderson,Andy,h1d1,"anderson, andy",Idaho (STATE); Alaska (STATE),text

I am Bill Ross, cattle rancher from Jordan Valley, Oreg. I have cattle in Idaho as well as Oregon. I am also president of an organization called Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. at the present time. I&#39;m going to address the issue of desirability of increasing the wilderness rather than arguing on the specific location that should or should not be wilderness. I think that in the State of Idaho there is an unlimited potential for wilderness. We can assess all that we are studying now and swallow it up in the wilderness program and that doesn&#39;t satisfy anyone very shortly. The same people are coming back and asking for another area. And we are darn sure there&#39;s some that qualify. I think that we should certainly have enough wilderness for now and the foreseeable future in Idaho. Good heavens, when you look at the tremendous amount of land that is locked up in wilderness at the present time that is taken out of the purview of lands that should be developed or can be utilized for economic purposes, I think that Idaho has done its part for this country in providing wil derness untrampled â€” what do you call it? â€” land where a man is a visitor. I don&#39;t believe enough people benefit from it. Certainly not enough Idaho citizens. I don&#39;t think we need to provide all of our State as a giant play ground for the masses from the metropolitan areas and the rest of the country.

Senator McClure, Senator Symms, Congressman  Craig, I am Dave Bivens, executive vice president of the Idaho Cattlemen&#39;s Association, a statewide organization representing in terests of beef cattle operators across the State. The Idaho Cattlemen&#39;s Association has adopted a general policy regarding roadless and wilderness designation in Idaho. The ICA policy involves two parts: We are very firm in our opposition to any additional wilderness or roadless designation in Idaho and, too, we ask that these areas presently tied up in roadless study areas be released to be managed and used under multiple use. The ICA feels that Idaho has already contributed more than its share to wilderness, presently some 3.8 million acres of land. We are very opposed to sacrificing more of our Federal lands in Idaho to be put into mothballs. Idaho definitely needs to expand its tax base and develop job opportunities, rather than reduce them. We in the livestock business are vitally interested in the amount of forage and water available for cattle production. However, we are also extremely concerned about the other uses of our public lands: mining, timber harvest, and the other uses of these lands for recreation and enjoyment. They all generate revenue and provide jobs for business and government within our State. A reduced number of jobs, other than by Federal agencies, and a poor business climate quickly reflect back on the taxpayer by a re  164  duced amount of revenue to support our schools and provide serv ices at the State and local levels. Without these funds we are forced to choose between reducing services and quality education or increasing taxes on State and local levels to satisfy the needs. We feel it is unnecessary to sacrifice additional land to be desig nated wilderness or roadless.  We sincerely believe that sound management of our national for  ests is multiple use without abuse, affording everyone an opportu nity to use and enjoy these lands, whether it be for mining, graz     ing, timber, hunting, fishing, or just plain enjoying the outdoors. This would not restrict the use to a few and discriminate against the elderly, the young, the disabled, and those middle and low income individuals working full-time for a living who don&#39;t have the time to enjoy those areas classified as wilderness and prohibit ing the use of wheels. We certainly hope that legislation can be adopted that will settle this question once and for all regarding the lock-up of these lands.

Many of these areas I don&#39;t understand where is a real conflict about wilderness designation. The areas, for the most part, lack minerals because, if they had minerals, they would be full of roads right now. The areas have been extensively explored in the past. And valua ble minerals for the most part have been located. Timber is probably the major problem in many areas. But on Challis, that&#39;s a small consequence. Much of the forest there is  169  very, very slow growing. For instance, in the Borah Range, it is called, or sometimes the Lost River Range, you have a timberline about 9,500 feet at the lower end because it&#39;s so dry, trees can&#39;t grow until you get to that elevation. At the same time you have an upper timberline of about 11,000 feet; the fact that it&#39;s too cold. So you have a very limited timber resource that exists here. The timber is much more valuable for its effect on watersheds, and so forth.","Thank you very much.

Thank you for the opportunity to appear before  the committee on a question regarding wilderness issues which are vital to Idaho. I am Jack Peterson, director and chief economist of the Idaho Mining Association. The association represents 15 operating mining companies and 21 exploration companies, mining, processing, ex ploring for mineral resources in Idaho. Sound and natural resource management is the result of multi ple management options based on multiple use concepts. To limit natural resources to a single use precludes management options for both current and future generations. We believe that limited resource allocations is essentially un sound. The policy of the Idaho Mining Association regarding na tional forest wilderness in Idaho is that Idaho has enough natural forests designated as wilderness. In fact, more than any other State in the United States except Alaska and, therefore, we will oppose additions to wilderness designations of natural forest lands in Idaho. The association will support the hard release of all lands in Idaho in wilderness study for further planning status to full multiuse status. To deny access to potentially valuable economic resources will weaken future options for Idaho&#39;s economy and there are profound national security consequences that could result from denying access for exploration and development for minerals, oil, and gas which may underlie areas under study for wilderness designation. Dedication of additional Forest Service lands to nonproductive wilderness status also has severe potential revenue implications which would reduce the income of county and State govern ments in Idaho. Thank you for the opportunity to present our views to the com mittee.

Thank you, Senator. Public ownership within the State of Idaho represents 69 percent of the State&#39;s total land area. Much of this ownership, 21 million acres, is in the hands of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the  Forest Service. These national forests contain a wealth of resources, both eco nomically important and esthetically pleasing. Development of these resources on these lands has contributed and will continue to contribute to the quality of life within the State of Idaho. Certain parcels of these lands have been designated by Congress as wilderness. These lands possess unique scenic and recreational values. Congress has preserved 3.8 million acres as wilderness. This is the largest contiguous wilderness in the United States. Roadless areas represent a different situation. The areas defined by RARE II as roadless total 6.5 million acres, 31 percent of the total national forest land in the State of Idaho. The designated roadless areas in the State of Idaho do not differ in quality more than the surrounding roaded areas. But by unconscious management decisions, they have remained unroaded, hence unavailable to the public for multiple use. Senator, I urge that no additional acreage be added to the exist ing wilderness within the State of Idaho. Idaho, as stated before, has the largest wilderness within the con tiguous United States. Addition of more acreage to the wilderness system will mean less jobs for the people of Idaho. Return those RARE II roadless areas to multiple use to preserve a good and growing quality of life in the State of Idaho.","Thank you very much.

Two of these are in Washington County, and there is one each in Adams, Cassia, and Idaho Counties. All of these are on national forest lands. In conducting our exploration activities on all of these properties, except the one in Idaho County, we have enjoyed cordial and effec tive working relations with the U.S. Forest Service personnel. In none of these areas, however, are there any designated road less areas or proposed wilderness areas.

Destruction of these two fine fish and game resource areas is nothing short of an insult to the citizens of the State of Idaho and the entire United States. We question the economics of road construction in our forests. We doubt that benefits measure up to costs in marginal and submarginal timber production lands. Without the subsidy provided by taxpayers in building these roads, we doubt that they would be built and that timber harvest from these lands would be foregone. This is in addition to the subsidy of turning our highways over to logging trucks. We have heard the argument that once these lands are in wilder ness, they will be locked there forever. Nonsense.

And those marginal lands that are now roadless and â€” or wilder ness â€” in my opinion should be considered for their highest and best use. And when they are considered for their highest and best use, I believe they would become recreational areas rather than logging     areas.  I would also propose that, in summary, if we would in fact put logging on a profitable basis, if we would stop subsidizing logging, make every logging show a higher income than outgo for roads, it would solve the problem by itself. Therefore, logging would only be accomplished when the scenic and recreational values â€” meaning water pollution and the other programs that serve the people of Idaho â€” would be accomplished, and especially the taxpayers.

In this period of low income and poor economy, we should be en couraging exploration in this State, not shutting out more areas. Approximately 10.8 million acres are under Federal lease or ap plication. One million of those acres are in the Panhandle Forests and about 30,000 acres in the Payette National Forest. They are, of course, unissued. Finally, 3.8 million acres is enough for single-use designation. Leave the remaining forest lands open to multiple use so those of use who have reached the age of needing a vehicle, rather than our feet, to take us to the beautiful scenic spots, can enjoy them, too.

I am really pleased that you invited me to the hearing. And I would like to say that my name is Janet O&#39;Crowley and apparently the lady who made up the program didn&#39;t believe that there was a Picabo, but  that is where I am from. I am here to speak particularly about the Smoky Mountain Wil derness area recommended by the Forest Service for wilderness designation. I have a strong affinity for this area. My family has used it and enjoyed it since 1910. My father and brothers have had mining claims in close to that area just outside the wilderness boundary. The air quality, the water quality, the unparalleled scenic value, and the wildlife habitat are what have defined the Idaho standard of living. This year, a couple of Saturdays ago, as I was coming out of this area, I passed one car per mile driving up in the forest. With our population increasing at 32 percent per year, it is easy to see the need to preserve what these people are cutting out to see: A core of wilderness at the heart of this well-loved and over-used area where water, air, wildlife can recuperate so we don&#39;t love the area to death. It does something for me every time I visit it and I know that it wouldn&#39;t be here if it hadn&#39;t been protected as a forest. And what I am asking is, wilderness is the one gift of nature you can never recapture once it is gone. If you believe in conservatism and conservation in saving some for our children, you have only one choice. And that is to include or keep the door open for as much wilderness as there is. We are only asking for 2 percent of what God gave us in the be ginning. So please don&#39;t say never to the wilderness. The Forest Service recommends it and so do I. And may I say that this is a unique position, being the last  speaker before lunch. Thank you very much, Senator.","Thank you very much. You gave us some food

Senator McClure, I will use my time to speak very briefly in three areas: Economics, methods of decisionmaking, and  prime areas needing wilderness protection. Ever since the late 1960&#39;s when wilderness in Idaho became a se rious issue, we have heard dire predictions about what will happen to Idaho&#39;s economy if we, quote, lock it all up. None of these gloomy forecasts have ever been borne out, and I don&#39;t believe they are accurate on this issue, either. In fact, we Idahoans should feel fortunate that tourism, a clean, uncomplicated industry requiring little regulations, has now become our second largest industry. So it certainly makes sense to save areas which would be attractive to out-of-State visitors. Second, various information made available by the media as well as mailings come directly from your office, Senator, talks about percentages of wilderness that might be added. These percentages range from 0 percent to 22 percent. If I found a diamond mine in my backyard, it would be my choice to keep 100 percent of it. I would certainly hope that final decisions on how much more wilderness we have will be made solely on the basis of the unique value of the area. But attempting to arrive at a happy medium by choosing some middle-ground percentage is not a fair way to decide a question as important as this one is. Critical areas needing serious consideration for wilderness in southern Idaho are all of the following: The Payette Crest, the Saw316  tooth completion, the Boulder- White Clouds, the Northern Lemhis, and the Palisades.

Senator McClure, I am here to speak for the Idaho Conservation League&#39;s proposal, the endangered Idaho wildlife core. Wilderness. In his book, &#39;The Primal Minds&#39;, Jamake Highwater responds to the word wilderness. He says:  I am often appalled by what is implied by the description. After all, the forest is not wild in the sense that it is something needing to be tamed or controlled or har nessed. For Blackfeet Indians, the forest is the natural state of the world.     So what shall we do about our Idaho wilderness? How do we see these forests, these lands, these mountains, rivers, lakes, and all  the wildlife therein? We can choose to see with eyes for the x number of board-feet or x number of dollars to be made, or we can see the qualitative rather than the quantitative values of our wilderness areas. We can see the quality of time in places untouched and un spoiled. We can see as we envision our children&#39;s children and their longings for wilderness and the natural resources that might be tapped in their time. It says something about us when we can set aside land rather than try to manipulate it and dominate it. It says that we care about the Earth. And, folks, Idaho is the Earth, too. So let us coop erate with Nature rather than trying to win it over, for as Highwater states: &#39;In the process, we can lose ourselves.&#39; Senator McClure, along with many, many others, I am counting onyou to guard well our Idaho wilderness.

Senator McClure and Congressman Craig, my name is Chuck Blair. And I&#39;m speaking on behalf of the Idaho chapter of the Wildlife Society. The Wildlife Society is an international organization of profes sional wildlife biologists with approximately 200 members in the Idaho chapter. As the outcome of these proceedings likely represents the last op portunity to make decisions concerning the fate of Idaho&#39;s remain ing 6.5 million acres of roadless forest lands we, as professional wildlife biologists, support the National Wildlife Federation&#39;s pro posal, proposal 4 from your newsletter, the addition of 4.5 million acres of wilderness to the wilderness preservation system. I will briefly touch on the highlights of our written testimony here.  352     The primary reason for our support of proposal 4 is that it en compasses the preservation of entire ecosystems. All the other pro posals seek to preserve only disjointed parcels of land. One of the key principles of ecology is that healthy ecosystems function prop erly only when left intact. Proposal 4 seeks to preserve the integri ty of entire systems. The preservation of endangeed species such as the woodland cari bou is totally dependent on maintaining its habitat as part of a complete, functioning system. We will eventually lose the caribou and other endangered species in Idaho if preservation of their habi tat is not adequate.  Protecting the integrity of entire watersheds also maintains the excellent fishery resources and high water quality we now enjoy in Idaho. Tourism is the second most important industry in the State. People come from around the world to backpack in the Sawtooths or float down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. Tourists can go anywhere in the west to see deficit timber sales and logging roads, but they come to Idaho to enjoy a wilderness ex perience. And they will continue to come to Idaho only â€” excuse me, in ever-increasing numbers only if we have something unique to offer them. We in Idaho have a system of values we use to judge our quality of life; a life centered around the enjoyment of vast acreages of un spoiled land. If we do not see fit here and now to preserve adequate acres of wildlands where man is but a temporary visitor rather than a despoiler of nature, this quality of life we hold so dear will be severely diminished.

I&#39;m Charles Wells, an 8year student of natural resources, resource management and pres ently enrolled in the College of Forestry at the University of Idaho.  As I see it, the advantages of roadless areas are manyfold. Fore most, they are economical. They offer a wealth of knowledge for the future and they are part of the natural heritage that has made this country great. Unroaded areas offer mankind the purest water available. Not only is this important for some fisheries and wildlife, but also for the future of mankind. Water for human consumption is going to become increasingly more valuable. Not only to the people of Idaho, but more impor tantly to the people outside the State who depend upon Idaho&#39;s waters in order to enjoy a standard and quality of life that we all hold sacred.  415     Unroaded areas offer mankind a gene pool from which to observe the evolutionary development of certain strains of genetically supe rior commercial species that can naturally ward off some insect and disease epidemics. The collection of seed from these hearty individuals, combined with the proper sidvacultural practices, on high productive, cut over roaded areas, will produce further stand of high quality timber at a long-term economic savings, since the road network has already been established. Unroaded areas offer mankind the ultimate in outdoor recrea tion experiences, such as solitude, hiking, hunting, camping, pho tography, wildwater boating and more. Recreation and tourism is presently ahead of timber as far as being a money making industry here in Idaho. A lot of what attracts the outside mining into this State are the wild qualities of unroaded areas. To hastily disturb these unroaded areas without first studying and considering all possibilities, both economically and otherwise, would be cutting off the hand that feeds Idaho for the future.","Thank you, Mr. Wells.

I see the possibility down the road, perphaps as soon as 10 or 20 years, when clean, cold water may be as valuable to our children and grandchildren as petroleum is to us now. Most of the roadless areas in question here today are important sources of naturally controlled, unpolluted streams. I am not total ly opposed to all logging and mining. I am opposed to opening these roadless areas to development and multiple use all at once. We must not degrade these watersheds. I feel that current methods of road building and mineral explora tion do not offer adequate safeguards against erosion and stream siltation. Since there is a significant number of available timber sales with no takers, and many of those which are bid are concluded as a defi cit to the taxpayers, I cannot justify hard release. The watershed, fish, wildlife, conservation and recreation values are more than worthy of the old, slow and careful processes toward development. Thank you very much.","Thank you. Dick Meyer?

My recommendations to this committee on the Forest Service RARE II â€” are the Forest Service RARE II recom mendations of 1979 and for a possible State wilderness bill, are es sentially the same. Review of our 1979 position did not result in recommending any additional roadless areas for wilderness. However, the past 4 years have seen additional instances where fish and wildlife values have been diminished by construction of roads into previously unroaded areas, strengthening our conviction that the few remaining areas with exceptionally high fish or wildlife values must have wilder ness classification to retain these qualities. In the national forests, emphasized at this particular hearing, the commission specifically recommended wilderness classification for the roadless areas designated as 4.061, 10 miles east in the Saw tooth and Boise National Forests. This area, continuous to the northwest corner of the Sawtooth Wilderness Area, contains the Hanson Lakes and is a logical addi tion to insure the protection of the lakes and adjacent elk summer range.  The commission also takes the position that any State wilderness  bill should not include the so-called hard release wording. Roadless  areas not classed as wilderness should come under the ongoing planning processes of the various national forests and considered for allocation to any of the various management prescriptions as provided for under the National Forest Management Act of 1976.",,FRED CHRISTENSEN,"IDAHO FISH AND GAME, COMMISSION",Christensen,Fred,h1d1,"christensen, fred",Boise National Forests (FOREST); Sawtooth Wilderness Area (WILDERNESS),text

Being a fisherman, hunter, backpacker, and actively involved in agriculture, deciding what I personally would like to see done with Idaho public lands, both State and Fed  eral, has not been an easy decision to reach. I have enjoyed many trips, both afoot and horseback, into Idaho&#39;s existing wilderness areas. However, I have also enjoyed a greater number of trips into multiple use areas that has previously been logged or had seen limited mining. Many times the marks left by previous inhabitants have added to, rather than detracted from, the asthetic value of an area. However, this does not mean that I favor all projects applying to developmental permits. Projects the size of the Cyprus Mine in Challis need to be developed very carefully and I am concerned about the Challis area, due to the Cyprus project. I&#39;m also concerned about the effect that additional wilderness would have on many communities and less densely populated coun ties of Idaho whose economy is based on mining, timber, and agri cultural industries and whose local government services, 3uch as roads and schools, which have been supplemented by Federal land payments. Although wilderness areas are fine places for extended trips, they are oftentimes, due to their nature, very difficult to enjoy on a weekend outing and the majority of the people who head for the hills on a tight time schedule and would not be able to go at all if more time were needed for the trip. There are also those who, because of age, physical conditions, or handicaps, are not able to go into wilderness or no motor vehicle areas. These people would be far better off to have all the wilder ness areas sold off to private concerns, developed and put onto tax rolls. However, this would not be fair to those of us who enjoy and use these areas. On the other hand, to put Idaho into a position where the largest planned industry is recreation is to place our State into an economy that is more susceptible to economic swings and fads or hobbies of people from other areas.

This will be a short summary of my longer written testimony. Once in Yosemite after an hour&#39;s hike up a trail, I found at the top a hot dog stand. This is an extreme and somewhat comical analogy, but it does indicate that what was once wild and expan sive had become small and civilized. We have a jewel here in Idaho, a precious commodity that will become more valuable as people continue to seek experiences in the outdoors. I moved to Idaho because it has something you can&#39;t get in other States, vast areas of clear water, undeveloped land and abundant wildlife. Without these Idaho would have no unique characteristics. It would offer nothing that couldn&#39;t be found in Oregon, Washington or any of the other Western States. We cannot allow too much of the State to be opened to roads, mining and logging and with sub sequent destruction of the ecosystem and still expect the opportuni ty we have become accustomed to. While I am aware that many people are unemployed and there are countries in an endless search for new energy resources, it is time that our long term decision for wilderness outweigh those short term economic decisions. Opening our .wilderness to logging and mining will not meet our Nation&#39;s needs. I support legislation that includes at least 50 percent of the re maining roadless areas. That includes what is referred to as the Endangered Core and that includes soft release language as op posed to hard release language. Hard release language is a term used to refer to a possible clause in future legislation that will bar lands not designated wilderness during pending legislation from ever being considered for such status in the future.

Thank you, Senator. Last year I was the project director of a symposium called Man, Wildlife and the Public Land, which was held in Boise in the fall. During the course of this project, I learned a great deal about the people and the wild land and wildlife of Idaho.  Based on what I learned I would encourage you to designate the maximum numbers of acres possible as wilderness in Idaho. De spite our 33 million acres of public land, the quality of our recre ational opportunities has actually diminished. According to 1980 projections by the U.S. Soil Conservation Serv ice, merely 18,000 acres a year are converted from brush to irrigat ed cropland in Idaho. About 6,000 acres are added to urban development and another 14,000 acres are going into recreational development and summer homesites. Also in the past 10 years the population of Idaho has grown 32 percent, from 712,000 to over 944,000. Every field, every open space, every vacant lot that is developed, puts more and more pressure on our Federal and State recreation al areas. The situation is much worse in other States where wilder ness areas have been adversely impacted by urban growth. We sometimes forget, too, that this is a shared habitat, and if we don&#39;t expand our wilderness system we will lose threatened species such as the bobcat, grizzly bear, white sturgeon, caribou, peregrine falcon, and salmon and steelhead, probably by the year 2000. In the future, yes, we might have shortages of gas, oil, coal, ura nium, but that is partially the result of our own waste and short sightedness. But let&#39;s not be shortsighted about wilderness. Even worse than a lack of these natural resources would be the lack of enough wilderness.

Our membership enjoys both the roadless areas and those that are accessible by roads as they relate to fisheries. We feel, however, that the number of true blue ribbon trout streams will continue to decline if they are not protected.

The other is the Hoodoo Great Burn Area, in the Clearwater National Forest, comprising the Kelly Creek, Cayouse Creek and Toboggan Creek Drainage. These areas have outstanding fisheries as well as wildlife resources. First of all, the Danskin, South Fork of the Boise, roadless area. The South Fork of the Boise River below Anderson Ranch Dam has been a pet project for the Boise Fly Fishermen since 1976 when hatchery trout were no longer introduced into the stream. We&#39;ve done considerable work to provide spawning habitat and have worked harder to strive for special fishing regulations to insure a quality trout stream. Our club, in addition to many other concerned groups, has joined forces to make sure the minimum stream flows would be insured and that such destructive concerns as dredge mining would not be allowed in the pristine stream. It is a rare resource to have a stream such as the South Fork of the Boise River existing within such a short distance of our capital city. Some of the major spawning streams for the South Fork exist in the Danskin, South Fork of the Boise, roadless area. The terrain in this area is steep and contains few timber re sources. We feel this area is critical to insure trout spawning habi tat for this great stream and would recommend that this area should exist in a wilderness state.

I think now it&#39;s fallen to my turn and we&#39;re not going to stop. I support the granting of wilderness status for the areas identi fied by the Idaho Conservation League as the Endangered Wilder ness Creek and I intend to support the conservationist&#39;s and sports men&#39;s proposal when it is released this fall. I am opposed to the use of hard release language in wilderness legislation. I support soft re lease but I really feel it would be more proper in any area that re search indicated needed protection, could be protected as wilder     449  ness at any time, regardless of waiting for a Forest Service cycle to come in around 15 years. I feel that any areas so rugged and remote that timber sales would fall into a deficit category should be protected as wilderness now. Deficit timber sales are a wretched example of fiscal misman agement, which should be outlawed. Of all the taxpayer-supported subsidies to industry, this one is particularly offensive because it makes the public pay a company to cut public trees from public land and keep the profit. It&#39;s like paying a thief to come to your house to rob you. In any area where the establishment of wilderness could enhance the future of anadromous fish, I feel the issue should be sufficient reason to grant said protection and I would really think that it would behoove every sportsman and fisherman, all the way down to Columbia to be here to say the same thing. Specific areas most people have mentioned a lot of times. When I worked for the Forest Service in the late 1960&#39;s we surveyed two roads in the Deadwood Country and they were both abandoned be cause the road was â€” the terrain was too steep to support a perma nent road and I think this area should be protected as wilderness. Pioneer Mountains, I would support wilderness for. The White Cloud Boulder area. The people of Idaho have repeatedly supported wilderness or projects in the White Cloud Boulder area and I really think that should just go without saying. It should be protected. The roadless areas are an asset, especially, I think, the ones close to civilization. The Breadwinner area north of Arrowrock Reservoir is a major migration corridor for an estimated 12,000 of the 20,000 to 30,000 deer in the Boise River deer herd.

These  qualities are renewable and should be maintained. Tourism is Idaho&#39;s No. 2 industry. Logging in many â€” wait. Wil derness is compatible with four of the multiple uses offered our State, recreation, range, wildlife, and watershed. Logging in many areas damages our watersheds affecting the quality of ur streams and important fish resources, as well as the habitat of our wildlife. An example is the South Fork of the Salmon. In many areas the sparisty of timber does not justify the cost of roads. And since my son Jack mentioned the Breadwinner area for wilderness and I favor that, I will not go into that. Trinity Mountain is one of the Granite Peaks with its granite peaks, alpine lakes and meadows and trails offers good hunting and fishing and camping. Airmen from Mountain Home Air Base find this a welcome recreation area to spend their days off. The South Fork of the Boise offers quality fishing. The area should be classified as wilderness.

Mr. Senator McClure, Congressman Symms, I&#39;m thankful for this opportunity to come here to testify today. I&#39;ve     come here to ask that you help us preserve our beautiful scenic wilderness areas. If possible I would like to see them enlarged. The beauty presently found in our wilderness is probably unsur passed by that of any other State. A total number of acres now held in our wilderness is a very small amount, in my opinion, if we considered the total size of our country. It is evident that the natu ral beauty can be adequately protected only if the area is main tained as roadless. Roads almost always lead to destruction and abuse of any forest ed area. If you travel the Boise River, you will see examples of what I refer to today. A large portion of land there is being devasted by a small prospector or mine operations. They seem to come in from out of State, in most cases, dig up the  earth, and in general destroy the beauty, pollute the streams, then go away and leave it. I doubt that very little profit is realized for much of this activity. And the natural beauty is ruined forever. Also, in the North Fork of the Boise River are examples of what the logging industry does to destroy the beauty even worse. Many roads are left unmaintained an eroding the mountainsides afer the loggers have finished. Forest Service trails are destroyed, often by such activity and I know now that many of them will never be usable again by hikers and backpackers. The roads have caused considerable depletion of our game herds. Roads have caused the buffalo and elk to become extinct in the eastern United States. The roads have caused our elk and deer herds to be grossly reduced in size in Idaho. One of the reasons our state is so much better than most of our sister States, is that we have fewer roads. Some of our Eastern states have had most of their mountain scenery Eroded by the construction of too many roads. In the Blueridge Mountains, for example, millions of tourists travel Blueridge Parkway to enjoy the scenery, only to find that little can be seen of it because of the smog and: air pollution caused by their automobile exhaust. I would like to see the Trinity Mountain and the Steel Mountain area in Boise National Forest designated wilderness.","Mr. Blankenship, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, but

I&#39;m directing my comments to Lick Creek, French Creek, Rapid River and that part of the Gospel Hump from Smith Knob across to the South Fork and to the Pilot Peak area. These areas have high values for wilderness, hunting, fishing, hiking and camping. It has extremely steep slopes and very fragile soils. In the past, road building in this type of terrain has caused very much damage.  I  support wilderness classification  for these  areas.  I  have hiked and ridden some of the trails in these areas and in stayed on the trail, damage was slight. But of all the trails I&#39;ve hiked, all the trails I have hiked which have seen bike use, have suffered. It appears that very few bike riders can resist the temptation to cut switchbacks and ride across coun try. The misuse of a trailbike can cause a great deal of damage. The timber industry claims that they need more timber. But at the same time they call for a 5-year extenison on the timber con tracts already bought. To me this just sounds like a lot of double talk. The Forest Service objective of the greatest good for the greatest number of people will be best met by wilderness classification. Thanks.","Thank you. Mr. Pat Ford.

I work for the Idaho Conservation League. I&#39;ve lived in Idaho for 32 years. I support inclusion as a minimum in  Idaho wilderness legislation of the 10 areas that we are calling the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core. We will submit for the record a more detailed description and ar gument for those areas by September 2, actually quite a bit earlier. Conservationists are also working hard across the State to put to gether a statewide proposal and we will get that together and submit it to you and make it public no later than October 1. And I would urge you to, if it is possible, to defer action on this legisla tion for a few weeks until you have our proposal before you and can consider it as you make your decisions. Let me now turn to release and perhaps add to the confusion, I don&#39;t know. My understanding of hard release, and I think it&#39;s the understanding of most people who have testified here, is based on language in a number â€” it was introduced in Congress in the last few years, the RARE II Review Act is one, Senator Hayakawa&#39;s bill. That was a bill that you supported, Senator McClure, as I un derstand. That language in that bill would have forbidden the Forest Serv ice from ever again studying released lands for wilderness or man aging released lands for wilderness without the express congres sional approval. That provision, then, as outlined, reverses current laws govern ing national forest management and effectively limits the possibili  483  ty that any forest lands will be designated wilderness in the future.  It is explicit in both the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act and the     National Forest Management Act, which are the two major recent  legislation governing the Forest Service today that wilderness is, and should be, an option for consideration in the national forest planning and management. In other words, wilderness is accorded quality status with other multiple uses of the national forest as an option for Forest Service land managers to consider. Conservationists support that existing legally established process. The National Forest Management Act mandates consideration of wilderness in the forest planning process and establishes a scheme whereby areas can be periodically re viewed and considered for addition to the wilderness system, just as areas are also periodically reviewed and considered for other multi ple uses. Senator, your point earlier today that with hard release, the Forest Service Could still recommend released areas for wilderness may be true. I&#39;m not sure about that, to tell you the truth. But as I interpret hard release, the recommendation would be a paper recommendation only with no connection to manage ment decisions the Forest Service can make. So based on that understanding, I oppose hard release language in Idaho legislation. Thank you.","Thank you. Well, I&#39;ll get back and ask you a

For the record, Senator Symms, I&#39;m a carpenter and I would guess that at least 90 percent fo the carpenters I work with strongly favor wil derness. At least the ones in my generation. Until the tract-housing boom of the post World War II era, the Forest Service had been known as a conservation organization. But private industries have overcut their own lands and began pressur ing the Forest Service to change its conservation self views to that of a supplier to industry. It&#39;s ironic that most of the high quality timber growing land is in private holding. But large industry has not, until recently, man aged their land with an eye for the future. The industry is now ad vocating final liquidation of western America&#39;s remaining public old growth stands. They ask the public to give them this timber at a cost less than it can be grown even on the more productive private holdings and certainly much less than it would cost the public to replace this timber. The intermountain west, with discounted cost benefit anal ysis, certainly cannot grow trees profitably on most of its public land. This situation begs that capital poor small tree farmers rape their holdings to compete with the Forest Service and it asks the next generation to subsidize our fat lifestyle and succeeding gen eration&#39;s consumption habits. I predict that the Forest Service&#39;s expensive management tech niques will not be subsidized by the next generation. To accomplish this liquidation the industry and the Forest Service cite jobs and community stability as the excuse. Yet, what is more rational, a stable phased in reduced logging base or the disastrous rapid falloffs of logging seen in many west coast communities? What is needed is a national debate concerning the subsidy to western timber companies. The Nation as a whole",,BILL WEAVER,,Weaver,Bill,h1d1,"weaver, bill",America (COUNTRY),text

There are many recreational as well as educational benefits to this hobby, including the fields of geology, minerology, crystalography, lapidary, paleontology, and other related fields.

The board of the Idaho Gem Club believes that there should be no changes in land use management, but that land use should stay the same as at present with multiple use.

Thank you, Senator. My name is Pauline Plaza, and I am a regional representative of the National Audubon Society,  speaking today on behalf of the Golden Eagle Audubon Society here in Boise. We have 440 members in this chapter, 20,000 in our region, and half a million in the Nation. The chapter supports designation of more of Idaho&#39;s pristine wild country as wilderness. We now back designation of the 4.5-million acres recommended by the Idaho Wildlife Federation, which in cludes the endangered Idaho wilderness core. A comprehensive con servationist proposal will be out in October for your consideration. Wilderness provides us a chance to preserve intact ecosystems complete with their full complement of wildlife. In Idaho, you still have wild areas that support top predators lost to other parts of the country, for example. Human life and civilization, all of our culture, depends for its ex istence on the natural processes which still operate unfettered in wilderness. We need to study these processes, learn from them, adapt to them. Failure to adapt means enormous loss of human life, human property, and financial and economic resources. Wilderness can tell us how to avoid such mistakes, how to best manage nonwilderness. Planet Earth didn&#39;t come with a book of instructions. Wilderness provides us with whatever pages of that book we can construct. The Golden Eagle Audubon Society believes that any wilderness lands that are not designated wilderness in this round of legislation should be reconsidered in the next planning cycle, or sooner, if Idaho citizens see the need for it. This option must not be fore closed.  Finally, given that many timber stands in these wilderness areas cannot be economicaly managed for timber production in the longor the short-term, that many wildlife values accrue to the old growth timber, intact watersheds, pure water, clean air, solitude and other attributes of wilderness area, we urge you, Senator, to do justice to Idaho&#39;s remaining wild lands.

In the course of my work with the State of Idaho, I travel ap proximately 120 days a year in the entire State. I work with the surface and place mining in the State, in the area of reclamation. I would like to say that my personal views of the State, and I will follow up with specifics in written testimony, this year in the areas of Stanley and Salmon, I could not get a room in the town of Salmon, and I have a hard time eating meals because of river rafts and such. It appears that this has just been generated since the River of No Return Wilderness that there has been tremendous in crease in the interest of the river systems. A Forest Service employee told me that this year he can antici pate when the town of Salmon will no longer have a sawmill, and in fact it is being more or less overrun or crowded out by the other interests in the other groups. It seems that the people who want to hold onto the timber industry in some of these areas are going to be of a dying race, and that it is time to look to the newer things of the future of what the industry is going to there. The same is true of the town of Riggins where the sawmill burned a year or so ago. It has now been rebuilt, and this year the town is basically booming, and it is all in the interest of floating the main Salmon that is now part of the River of No Return Wil derness, the lower stretches of that river. I think the timberlands, my personal degree is in the area of for estry, looking at the close ranges and the southern treatment for your fiber needs. In Idaho, we should look at these other uses. They are long-term and they are going to be there. The minerals, explo ration, geochemical, geophysical go on. At this point, molybdenum is a strategic mineral in the White Clouds as such. We don&#39;t need to exploit these minerals at this time. As Senator Symms said, some 20 to 30 years from now, Congress can look at the issue again, and maybe be interested in some of these areas because of strategic needs. I agree, we should document those values and look at those as much as we can. I think we can do it with geochemical and geo physical means. I think the emphasis is there. We want to upgrade  560  the mineral program also. Look at the 1872 mining law and miner al leasing and why we give those minerals away, and don&#39;t sell them like timber.

I appreciate this, Senator. My comments basically will be limited to some of the area that you are so familiar with, your old hunting country in Iron Moun tain, Mann Creek, Robinson Creek, that area north of PayetteWeiser, and west of Council, Cutty Mountain, that area. I don&#39;t know if you have had any opportunities since January of 1967 when you went back to Congress to do any hunting, and it is unfortunate if that is the case, because if you had, I think you would be relatively surprised as to what has been going on. The old Weiser National Forest as the early day foresters have managed it is entirely different. The watershed devastation is just immense. The Weiser River, proposed Weiser River-Galloway Dam that so many people across the State highly talk about is being jeopardized by the sediment production coming off of that 400-plus square miles of national forest land all because of a vast departure of sus tained yield production accompanied with accelerated road con struction program whereby logs used, what do I want to say, dol lars in exchange for road construction by Boise Cascade, Evergreen and other mills. You can just see the handwriting on the wall in that country is that what has happened, either the Evergreen Mill or the Council Sawmill or Boise Cascade by 1995 is going to be gone, or going to be another Riggins casualty or another McCall casualty. You can just see the handwriting on the wall. The elk habitats have deteriorated. It is just amazing to speak to natives and visit with the old-timers â€” well, people my age, that feel like it is just modern-day forestry, and that this is what hard re lease is going to amount to.

I grew up all my life in McCall, and I grew to love all the mountains around there, the lakes at Payette.  I  never worried about them being abused or hurt, because every     thing was so big, and there was air, and space, and rocks, and trees, and water, and no stifle time, and it didn&#39;t matter. I loved it so much, and I still do.  I went away to Massachusetts for 2 years to go to school, and learned and saw all the things that were back there, like acid rain in the Adirondacks that wilts all the trees instead of giving them anything to drink. Toxic waste that lie along the road in New Jersey. All I could think of with all of this industrialization and pave ment, and crap around me was thank God, I can still go home to Idaho, and everything will be OK again. I am going to make sure that that doesn&#39;t happen here. Obviously it is not the same problems in Idaho as there are in New Jersey or New York, but the effects of industry and develop ment are the same, because I still feel the sickness in my stomach when I see a clearcut, and when I see sheep that have destroyed a whole meadow for how many years, and I can&#39;t drink out of a stream. I feel the same thing that I did when I saw the rainbowcolored ponds in New Jersey. I am still young, and still full of optimism. That may sound silly, because most of the people who have talked, they seem really bitter. But because I do come home and see that nature still works, and everything is OK I am almost done.

I refuse to believe that we can ignore the lessons that should have been taught to us by the other places that are ruined. I refuse to believe that you would sacrifice the wild lands for the immediate benefits of industry around here like they have on the east coast, and other places in the world.

This has been a very expensive process. These lands have all contributed in the past to the level of multiple use, which includes our annual timber harvest. This is to say, Senator McClure, that in fact these lands have been in alloca tion and have been allocated in the past in determining the poten tial yield and annual cuts from the national forest. And we have depended on those, and the timber industry has developed its man ufacturing facilities, and the local employment basis is primarily predicated on the fact that those will continue. These roadless areas that we&#39;re talking about were identified a long time ago that some day they would become â€” put into demand ing State and would continue to contribute to that annual cut. We need to have this timber industry continue at the present level, and it can only do that if this roadless issue is resolved and it&#39;s re solved so that the commerical forest lands that are within it are maintained. The timber industry has spent a considerable amount of time and energies in recommending a reasonable wilderness bill. Its compromise suggests additional wilderness lands to bring the total to over 4.4 million acres. It also resolves the costly sufficiency questions and identifies for the Secretary of Agriculture the multi ple-use direction for the remaining areas. There has been many concessions made by the forest industry in order to support these recommendations. Some individuals would prefer that there be no increase in the wilderness system above the present levels, and that the already immense 3.8 million acres be reevaluate for some declassification; however, these concessions of the timber industry have been made in good faith.  575  The timber industry in southeast Idaho is partially represented on this panel. Their individual presentations will in fact demon     strate not only the industry&#39;s importance to southeast Idaho, but also its very strong dependence on our national forest multiple-use outputs. Currently an atmosphere of instability exist with most re source user groups. Even our experienced employees currently feel uncertain about their future jobs. It must be remembered that the massive public response to RARE II overwhelmingly recommended that the resource base be protected, and that additions to the wil derness system be restricted to specific deserving areas. There was little support for large additions to the wilderness system.",,BURT LILLIS,"CHAIRPERSON, SOUTHEAST IDAHO TIMBER INDUSTRY",Lillis,Burt,h1d2,"lillis, burt",,text

Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity of present ing testimony at this hearing. My name is Paul Wenner and I am here representing the Louisianna Pacific Corp. of Rexburg, Idaho. I have been professional forester for over 20 years.  I endorse the Idaho Forest Industry Council&#39;s proposed Idaho Wilderness Act which would add another 600,000 acres to the exist ing 3.8 million we now have in wilderness in the State, and it would also declare that final RARE II environmental impact state ment for this State was legally and factually sufficient and would allow those lands to be managed without jeopardy. Our company employs directly and indirectly, through our em ployees and our contractors, over 85 people in this part of the State. Using a simple multiplier effect of two, this generates almost 6 million annually into the economy. Our industry needs a decision made on the RARE issues, so that they can be assured of a steady supply of raw materials for the future. Without such a decision we may see our industry drastically reduced in the future. The local geographic area currently has extensive areas of wil derness and wilderness type recreation. This is an area such as Grand Tetons, Yellowstone National Park, John D. Rockefeller Me morial Parkway, Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Craters of the Moon National Monument. The industry recommended wilder     581  ness areas of Lionhead, Worm Creek, the West Slopes of the Tetons, and Borah Peak. Areas that have been tied up through the RARE processes such as Bear Creek, Poker Peak, Caribou City, Stump Creek, Gams Mountain, Palisades, and Bald Mountain do not have the unique characteristics necessary for preserving as wilderness. The bound aries of these units of roads inundating into their course, which leaves us narrow corridors of roads within their boundaries. Items not identified that do not meet wilderness charateristics are items such as a cabin located on Bear Creek in the Bear Creek unit, mining and terracing on Big Elk Mountain within the Bear Creek unit, motorcycle trails in the Palisades, and motorcycle trails clear to the top of Garns Mountain, a power line within the boundaries of the Palisades unit, and the oldest Federal highway west of the Mississippi which was financed by Congress in 1856, the Lander Cutoff Road which goes right through the center of the Stump Creek unit. Insects are raising havoc with our forests in this area. Currently we have almost 80 percent of the pine has been killed by the Moun tain Pine Beetle, and the Western Spruce Budworm is almost single handedly eliminating all reproduction in the Douglas-fir stands. Extensively timbered areas in the previously mentioned units need to be managed and converted to a healthy state. The lands classified by the Forest Service as suitable timber lands within Palisades, Garns Mountains, Caribou City, Bear Creek, and Poker Creek, Poker Creek area, could easily sustain a mill the size of ours. Instead these lands have been tied up for nearly two decades. Action is needed now to release these lands for long needed mul tiple-use management.

My name is Bruce Dunn; I represent the Idaho Stud Mill, a division of Idaho Forest Industries. Our company&#39;s oper  ation in eastern Idaho is located in St. Anthony. We have approxi mately 100 employees working at the mill and approximately 200 more people working in the woods for contractors to the mill. Our concern, quite naturally, would be providing a long-term raw material base the continued operation of the mill, the jobs, and northeastern Idaho&#39;s economic stability and well being. We have been involved in the RARE II discussions since the be ginning of the process with emphasis on the Targhee National Forest. We have seen some changes in the areas that were original ly considered, such as Warm River North-South-East, which have been dropped from further consideration a candidate wilderness areas. They are now being harvested primarily because of the dead and dying lodgepole pine located on them. We feel, and most people in this part of the State also feel, that this is a very viable ap proach on these areas. These areas are now being successfully, nat urally, and artificially regenerated with trees; they are also produc ing increased summer into the wildlife, an example being that the  589     elk herd on the winter range has increased to 3,000 head. We do  not have to go into a long discussion or dissertation as to the dead and dying lodgepole pine situation on the Targhee National Forest, but we should discuss, and probably will discuss, the Douglas fir situation in the forest. A recent report by the USDA Forest Service has shown a dra matic increase in the supreme budworm activity on the Targhee National Forest. The spruce budworm attacks Douglas fir, subalpine fir, and spruce, all which occur as commercial species on the Targhee. As a destructive agent, the spruce budworm is usually not too serious; however, the defoliation has been occurring in increas ing magnitude over the last 3 years. These repeated defoliations weaken the tree and provide an avenue for other insects and dis eases to attack and destroy the tree. Since the Douglas fir on the forest is also in an overmature state, and since the lodgepole pine is already in a dead and dying state, the Targhee could face serious problems in the new future on management, not only of their lodgepole pine stands but also of their Douglas fir stands. Two areas on the northeastern part of the Targhee that do have commercial Douglas fir stands that are infested are the Mount Jef ferson area and the Lionhead area. We endorse the Lionhead area for wilderness classification be cause of its unique characteristics; however, the lower portions, es pecially of the Mount Jefferson area, could be released for timber management. Another area of impact in eastern Idaho is the west slope of the Tetons. The west slop of the Tetons proposed wilderness, or the Jedidiah Smith Wilderness area, as it is being named, is in Wyoming; but the primary access to the area is out of Idaho. The area ex tends from approximately the southern boundary of Yellowstone National Park to State Highway 33, which goes from Victor, Idaho, to Jackson Hole, Wy. We are not here to talk about Wyoming&#39;s wil derness proposals or bills, but we should recognize that the use in this area does come mainly from Idaho residents and that John Sessions, State representative from Driggs, has polled his congres sional district and has determined that the large majority of people living in this area would prefer to see the west slope of the Tetons left open to multiple use. Mount Jefferson, Lionhead, Jedidiah Smith Wilderness area, along with Yellowstone National Park, and the further study areas north and south of Palisades Reservoir would encircle eastern Idaho. This would remove a large portion of eastern Idaho&#39;s land base from multiple-use management. We therefore support the Idaho Forest Industry Council Wilder ness Act.

Bentley. My name is Jim Bentley; I am the forest lands Mr. manager for Champion&#39;s Rocky Mountain operation headquartered in Milltown, Mont.     590  Champion International Corp. owns and operates a sawmill in Salmon, Idaho, that employs 50 people with an annual salary and benefit payment of over $1.5 million. This figure does not include workers who directly support the running of the mill and whose jobs are dependent on the operation of the mill, but who are not on Champion&#39;s payroll. Our mill is a major source of employment in Salmon, Idaho. Since the Salmon mill requires 18 million board feet of timber annually, land use decisions that affect Salmon and the Challis National Forest are of concern to our company. Champion supports the Idaho timber industry&#39;s position to seek legislation which designates appropriate RARE II areas as wilder ness, releases nonwilderness RARE II lands for multiple-use man agement by the Forest Service, and declares the RARE II process legally sufficient. Passage of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act of 1980 had a signif icant affect on the future timber supplies of the forest products companies that depend on the Salmon and Challis National Forest. Five RARE II areas were made wilderness in the 1980 act; that was within close proximity to our Salmon mill. This represents a loss of nearly 350,000 acres of timberland and 7 million board foot of annual potential yield that would not be available for competitive timber sale bidding. This was a significant reason that led to the permanent closure of our mill in Northfork, Idaho. To help resolve the wilderness issue, we support the forest indus try position that an additional 600,000 acres of Idaho national forest land be added to the already designated 3.8 million acres of wilderness in Idaho. This proposal promotes the concept that qual ity and not quantity should be the basis of wilderness legislation. Wilderness designation is not the only way to protect the wilder ness area. If roadless areas exhibit wilderness attributes that are mixed with commercial forest land or other resources that require development, a roadless recreation management scheme can be uti lized by the Forest Service. This would allow a mixed variety of uses and still allow a nonwilderness land allocation. In addition, RARE II areas with significant amounts of commercial forest land should not be classified as wilderness. Reduction of commercial forest land available for long-term timber management will have a detrimental impact on both the forest products industry and the overall economy of Idaho. I have included a list of 13 RARE II areas totaling about 600,000 acres that the timber industry proposes to be included into the wil derness system. Two of these areas occur on the Challis National Forest: Pioneer Mountain, 105,000 acres, and Borah Peak, 120,000 acres. These two areas exhibit the special characteristics that make them worthy of wilderness classification. The remaining roadless lands on the Challis and Salmon National Forests should be uti lized for all resources to include timber management. Prompt resolution of the wilderness issue in Idaho is important to Champion and we stand willing to assist this committee in reaching a final solution.

Senator McClure, I want to thank you for the op  portunity to be able to appear here and testify before this hearing. My name is Bill K. Shurtleff, and I am a lifetime resident of Idaho. My grandparents moved to Idaho in 1887 and my family has been engaged in farming and ranching in the Swan Valley area since that time. I am presently president of Garland Call Pole Co. and Heritage Solid Wood Homes; both companies are engaged in the logging and manufacturing of wood products. It is my recommendation that Idaho&#39;s congressional delegation support no further wilderness areas within the State of Idaho. It is also my recommendation that the release language be definite enough that the managers of the land not be continually plagued with lawsuits and court proceedings, thereby destroying their abili ty to manage the land. On specific areas, I would like to make the following comments: In the Palisades: It is my understanding that this area has a high potential for oil and natural gas production. This country     594  would be foolish not to explore this area and produce all those energy sources needed. In the area of Rainy Creek all the way to Pine Creek: There are a number of grazing allotments which are dry, and water must be hauled to these areas. To place this land in wilderness would cause undue hardships on livestock owners to provide care and water without motorized vehicles. In the area of Garns Mountain: There are a number of communi cation facilities now present in that area. In order to maintain these units, it is necessary that they use motor vehicles both in winter and summer to keep maintenance and insultation and the production there. In summary I would like to say that a man needs three basic items: Food, fiber, and shelter. Wilderness provides none of these. It does, however, provide a quality of life after the three main items are satisfied. In my opinion we have all the wilderness that Idaho can afford. Let us now end this continuous debate and put this country back on the path of logical production. Thank you.","Thank you. Mr. Robin Jenkins.

The Chairman. Just a couple of questions. Mr. Wenner, you have
in the attachment to your statement, on page 1 of that attachment,
the question of insect infestation and bug kill of mature timber;
and you say in there that had the average age of the mature
timber been kept at 80 years of age, it is probable that the Moun
tain Pine Beetle would not have had the opportunity to reach the
epidemic proportions that are being experienced in which up to 80
percent of the trees are being killed. Now, that&#39;s the Lodgepole
Pine?
Mr. Wenner. That&#39;s in the Lodgepole Pine stands; yes.
The Chairman. And the Lodgepole Pine does almost manage
clearcut operation; does it not?
Mr. Wenner. That is, in my opinion, the best way to manage it
in this geographic area.
The Chairman. Because they&#39;re an even-aged stand?
Mr. Wenner. It&#39;s normally introduced after a fire, and the fire
has basically made a previous clearcut; therefore, it&#39;s subsequent
that they would be even aged after that.
The Chairman. Are you suggesting that in the Lodgepole Pine
areas we have in effect an 80-year rotation?
Mr. Wenner. That would be my suggestion, to be able to main
tain the stands in the healthiest state to withstand insects before
they start tapering off in their growth.
The Chairman. Mr. Lillis you referred to allowable cut. I think
that&#39;s something that perhaps is not well understood by people out
side the forest industry and I wondered if you could expand a little
bit upon how the roadless areas contribute to allowable cut.
Mr. Lillis. Senator, the allowable cut is just one of the aspects of
multiple use and it&#39;s calculated to try to bring the best enhance
ment to the most multiple uses of the land. The allowable cut is
the allowed timber harvest, and the Forest Service prepares the
sale in the best management practices that they can and sell it.
Annually the timber industry depends on those to come in â€” the

595

way that&#39;s been calculated in the past, that there has been either
an estimate or a very closely calculated answer as to the total in
ventory and it&#39;s total capability, and it&#39;s ability to sustain it&#39;s grow
ing in perpetuity, growing of trees. That annual growth is actually
the calculation to the allowable harvest, and so basically they have
a sustaining harvest into perpetuity, is the way that allowable cut
is calculated.
The Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, very much, I appreciate
your testimony.

Thank you, Senator McClure, and I apologize for being late. My remarks this morning will be around the prohlem of changing land use and how it affects the county and State government. I&#39;m Vearl Crystal, State senator, District 20; this dis trict comprises Jefferson, Clark, Lemhi, and Custer Counties. I am opposed to any further wilderness designation to Idaho forest lands, and especially in Custer and Lemhi Counties. Any change in land use, private or Federal, has the potential of econom ic impact on county government as well as State government. Custer County has 2,944,531 acres of federally owned land; this is 93.3 percent of the total land area of the county. Only a 154,778 acres is privately owned land, or 4.9 percent of the total area. The other 1.8 is owned by the State, county, and cities. Lemhi County is very similar to Custer County with 90 Vfe percent of the land owned by the Federal Government and 8 percent pri vately owned. Custer County has been impacted greatly by the purchase of 800 subdivided lots by the Sawtooth National Recreation Area from 1974 to 1980. This sale removed these valuable properties from the property tax base of Custer County. The scenic easement for pur chase also reduced the taxable value. Custer County is operating on warrants and tax anticipation notes at the present time because of the frozen budgets and in creasing costs. Any further deterioration of their tax base or nega tive economic impact could seriously curtail necessary services to county residents. School funds have also been negatively impacted in Custer and Lemhi Counties because of the reduction in 874 Federal funds. These funds are obtained from multiple-use forests: Federal em ployees, reservations, stumpage, and grazing fees. Any further re duction in multiple-use forests, because of wilderness designation, would further erode the revenue from these sources and subse quently impact our public schools. I think, with proper management, we can maintain our forests for multiple use and still preserve their esthetic values and retain the use of these natural resources for all people, not for just a fa vored few, if it is locked up in a wilderness designation.

Thank you, Senator McClure, I&#39;m glad to be here today. I am the Pacific Northwest vice president for the Sierra Club and also the chair of the Eastern Idaho Group, and I&#39;m speak ing for myself because some of my views may be at variance. I agree with you that it&#39;s time to settle the wilderness issue here in Idaho; it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been working on for 12 years and you&#39;ve been working on longer. And I think that we&#39;ve designated a lot of fine wilderness areas in Idaho and I do expect that 1 11 per  sonally support the conservationist&#39;s alternative when its drawn up, but I&#39;ve become convinced that the conservation organizations are devoting all too many resources to the wilderness question when there are better ways to preserve the land. And it appears to  597     me that one of the major problems we have is that these lands are high and unproductive, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re still roadless by and large, and were it not for the subsidies which are being granted the timber industry, most likely they never would be developed. And I&#39;m a strong supporter in the free market system and I believe that there&#39;s got to be a good reason before a subsidy is granted. And so what I&#39;m going to recommend to environmental organizations is that they devote less of their resorces to wilderness classification and more of it in the future to illuminating these artificial subsi  dies that are being given to the timber industry. I&#39;ve done extensive hikind throughout Idaho and my wife and I in fact are now editing a book called Hiking Guide to Idaho. I&#39;ll present in my written testimony specific comments about these areas but there&#39;s not time today. I would like to say a word about oil and gas. We first heard about most of it, the Idaho Overthrust Belt, in 1976 when large dis coveries were made in Wyoming and Utah. The Overthrust Belt seems to be an interesting geological concept, however which seems to expand or contract according to political criteria rather than ge ological criteria. If we had as much oil and gas discovered in the Idaho Overthrust Belt as we&#39;ve had in press releases from the oil industry about how much is here, I Think the country would be in good shape. I would like to point out that only a small part of the Idaho Overthrust Belt is restricted right now from oil and gas ex ploration and it&#39;s almost totally leased, and these leases run for 10 years. If the oil and gas industry can&#39;t find enough money to ex plore adequately the road and development portions of the Overth rust Belt, I don&#39;t know why they need to go into Palisades, Italian Peaks, Borah Peak, Mount Naomi, and Warm Creek. And as a matter of act, Italian Peaks, Mount Naomi, and Palisades are being explored at the present time under restrictive clauses which allow them to drill but they have to restore the land afterward; and there have been two unsuccessful wells in the Palisades which have been completed, and since, they&#39;ve been obliterated. So I think that there are really no conflicts between oil and gas exploration in eastern Idaho because the Overthrust Belt is so large and appropriate wilderness designation.

Mr. Thank you, Senator McClure. The Committee for Idaho&#39;s High Desert is a nonprofit, all-volunteer organization acting on behalf of wildlands, rivers, and wildlife. Our members  are committed to establishing permanent natural refuges for Idaho&#39;s diverse undomesticated species and firmly believe wilder ness management to be the most effective tool for this purpose. As president of the east Idaho chapter, I appreciate this opportunity to make the following points: First, Committee for Idaho&#39;s High Desert agrees with the Idaho Wildlife Federation that the 4.5 million acre RARE II alternative W ought to be the basis for discussion, per the ninth circuit court decision determining Forest Service recommendations for nonwilderness, invalid. Two, Committee for Idaho&#39;s High Desert strongly supports the endangered Idaho wilderness core proposal as an absolute mini mum, due to the critical fish and wildlife habitat and threats from ill-advised industrial exploitation of these 10 areas. Third, we are deeply concerned over accelerated timber develop ment within Targhee, Caribou, Salmon, and Challis National For ests. The arid climate and thin topsoil of eastern and central Idaho would compromise sustained yields as an inevitable consequence of reforestation difficulties. Moreover, existing growth is generally of such poor quality that taxpayers must subsidize access road con struction for lumber companies to turn a profit â€” fouling streams, scarring the landscape, and destroying wildlife habitat in the bar gain. Four, we criticize the Idaho State fish and game wilderness pro posal for exclusing virtually all of eastern and central Idaho. Fish and game personnel have defended their selection of Borah Peak on grounds of their Bighorn Sheep reintroducing efforts. Yes, rather curiously, fish and game reintroduction of Bighorn Sheep into Diamond Peak and Mountain Goat into Palisades apparently count for nothing. Critical fish and wildlife aspects of the North Lemhi, Lionhead, Cache Crest, and Garns National roadless areas were similarly disregarded. Fifth, the Pioneer, Borah Peak, and North Lemhi roadless areas are eminently deserving of wilderness status, due to the outstand ing wildlife and recreational values present. Each has an adjacent Bureau of Land Management wilderness study area â€” Little Wood River, Borah Peak, and Goldburg, respectively â€” that were recently dropped from further consideration by Interior Secretary Watt on the grounds of size. Committee for Idaho&#39;s High Desert feels that these three BLM riparian zones ought to be included within the na tional forest wilderness legislation. Six, many of you are aware of the crisis posed by desecration of archeological sites at the BLM Black Canyon wilderness study area near the unique Lost River Sinks. The unusual concentration of sites and criminal destruction thereof extends well into the adja  604     cent Diamond Peak roadless area. The Committee for Idaho&#39;s High Desert strongly believes that banning vehicular intrusions through wilderness management is an essential measure for enforcing an tiquities laws and for preserving these precious remnants of Idaho&#39;s prehistoric heritage. we propose a combined Diamond Accordingly, Peak/Black Canyon wilderness be included in the forthcoming wilderness bill. We note that any BLM protective actions for Black Canyon appar ently require approval of the Interior Secretary Watt. This urgent matter cannot tolerate the years of delay given by Watt to other BLM wilderness recommendations, such as for the Great Rift. Thank you, Senator.","Thank you.

Second, I would like to touch on the immediate need  provided for the endangered Idaho wilderness core in the areas of eastern Idaho which need to be a part of that core. The true purpose of wilderness classification is to maintain eco logical diversity. The impact that it has on individuals who explore, hike, who operate in the wilderness areas is one thing; the diversi ty is a true environmental control. Wilderness is created only by nature; it cannot be created by man, but it can be destroyed by man. Wilderness is designated by Congress; Congress does not enact laws which cannot be modified, amended, or eliminated. The Wilderness Act of 1964 was no exception. The law provides that under specific conditions, wilderness classification can be with drawn; hence, wilderness cannot be guaranteed forever. Thus, the wilderness dilemma, wilderness cannot be created, wilderness cannot be guaranteed, wilderness can be destroyed. Ordinary logic would dictate that wilderness classification should not be decided at any one single point in time; logic provides for the necessity of the further planning categories. In the wilderness legislature this is referred to, I believe, as release language. Land should not be excluded from the wilderness classifications unless it may demonstrate a particular resource that cannot be obtained elsewhere. It is important that we don&#39;t foreclose on future genera tions&#39; right to evaluate their needs. Maintaining lands in all such States provides that option and assures no economic benefits will be lost. Minerals will not evaporate nor migrate to Russia. Twenty years is not too long a time to exclude wilderness. The second point I would like to emphasize is the need provided for the endangered wilderness core. There are 10 areas throughout Idaho which should be included, and they have been mentioned previously and they will be mentioned in further times. Eastern Idaho contributes 3 of these 10 areas; that is, the Northern Lemhis,  606  the Palisades, and the Garns Mountains. In addition, at least 11 other areas meet all the criteria for wilderness classification. My favorite areas lie between Idaho batholith and the Montana border, and these are the Borah Peak, Pahsimeroi, the Diamond Peak, and the North Lemhi. These areas are geologically recent, rugged, and relatively free of conflicts. I see them characterized as fossils and flowers and eagles and antelopes.","Thank you very much.

Good morning, Senator. I&#39;m kind of giving this testi  mony not only for myself but as the chairwoman of the Idaho Con servation League. I would like to speak for members of the chap ters in eastern Idaho that could not be here today or that are writ ing in testimony later on. I wish to cover primarily the reasons why wilderness areas are necessary to the environmental and eco nomic health of this region, particularly. First, I think it&#39;s important to rid ourselves of the question that&#39;s very much too parochial and that is, how much wilderness should there be in Idaho? I really think we&#39;re talking about a national, not just a State resource. Sometimes I think we&#39;re talking about areas that are just within our boundaries, but we&#39;ve got to think nationally. The wilderness areas here hold an ever increasing sig nificance to both American and foreign visitors. I think we have a responsibility to consider Idaho&#39;s role in this national context just as we view our agricultural contributions on such a scale. But it makes sense, that because Idaho has enough food, to start asphalt ing over the rest of the agricultural lands jsut because we satisfy our own needs. Since resources aren&#39;t distributed equally among the 50 States, we need to consider wilderness in this context. Yes, maybe Idaho has more than its share, but we have to make up for other States. If hearings were held in California, Ohio, or Massachusetts chances are that the virtues of wilderness would be far more extolled and understood than they are sometimes in this State. So I suggest we argue not over numbers but really evaluate each area on its merits, especially in the area of watershed recreation and wildlife among the other multiple uses which are inherent in wilderness designation. Here in eastern Idaho we are privileged to have the opportunity to view wildlife in their natural habitats practically outside our back door. This privilege cannot be taken for granted much longer. The multiple use designation called wilderness is the only vehicle we now have to insure that quality wildlife habitat is preserved for future generations. All of the roadless areas on the Targhee, which I&#39;m most familiar with, have exceptional wildlife areas, primarily because these areas have low timber value and have not had easy access provided by roads. The Greater Yellowstone ecosystem in which I live, I live in Island Park among the dead trees, by the way, which encompasses many of the Targhee areas, contains one  607  of the greatest concentrations of endangered or threatened species including the grizzly bears and the Trumpeter swans. I feel it&#39;s our responsibility to preserve this wildlife habitat and it&#39;s a remnant of Western heritage in the areas such as Gams Mountain, Palisades,     and the Centennial roadless areas. As far as watershed goes, I think the value of wilderness in pro tecting critical watersheds is often overlooked. Because we have old growth forests containing density and diversity of vegetation, the natural springs and streams retain their high water quality in this area. Once roads are built for timber harvest this high quality re source is forever lost. Through logging activities, stream beds are forced to carry higher loads of sediment, decreasing their capability to sustain life. Many roadless areas protect the sources of our major rivers. For example where I live, the Centennial Mountains and the Lionhead area protect the watershed of the Henry&#39;s Fork of the Snake and that whole area that&#39;s so critical to our economic tourism values in Island Park. Since water plays such an impor tant role throughout Idaho, Senator McClure I feel we ought to see our obligation to preserve its long term viability.",,JANICE BROWN,"CHAIRWOMAN, IDAHO, CONSERVATION LEAGUE",Brown,Janice,h1d2,"brown, janice",California (STATE); Ohio (STATE); Massachusetts (STATE); Targhee (FOREST); Greater Yellowstone (FOREST); Island Park (CITY); Garns Mountain (LANDFORM); Palisades (LANDFORM); Centennial Mountains (LANDFORM),text

Good morning, Senator, I&#39;m going to summarize my testimony.  I believe there are three issues that form the core of these discus sions of the future of Idaho&#39;s wilderness. The first one is a critical one; an unprovided defensive need for any rapid legislation is, do those lands which have always been wilderness somehow threaten someone because they are wilderness? If they are not, then the need for any hasty legislation certainly should be questioned. On that question, and it&#39;s been touched upon by most speakers, would just mention the fact, that since it has not been fact even though it&#39;s been included in someone&#39;s ideas and perhaps unwise ly, it does not necessarily mean that it threatens anyone. These lands have been isolated back in theâ€” the word perpetuity has been used, certainly hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of  I  years.  The other question again mentioned by other speakers is that of the sales in Idaho are now deficit sales; that means they are subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer. If we need to have deficit sales out of timber as we take timber out of the U.S. National Forests, there can be some question whether we need to open more of it up. If we did that, we could only increase both the fiscal and environ mental damage by doing such things. So I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a justification for any hasty legislation. most     611  On the question if legislation is passed â€” and I recognize some times that things move forward with some inertia. If legislation is passed, I&#39;ll append to the list of areas which I think should be con sidered. If legislation is enacted rapidly, I suggest that all 5.6 mil lion acres of roadless area now existing in Idaho should be classed as an appended list of those. On the question of hard release, I consider that principle as em bodying the Wyoming Wilderness Act of 1982, section 2118, to be quite a dangerous ill-conceivance. I realize we don&#39;t have legisla tion throughout Idaho yet, and I hope that if legislation is proposed for Idaho, that it be first-classed, rather than through radical no tions. The question on hard release is, it would preclude proper Forest Service management of lands. It would prohibit the Forest Service from an orderly and reasoned land management planning process. It would prohibit implementation of the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act. It would mandate second-class status to wilderness because under existing Federal laws that we now have, we now have the requirements that the Forest Service con sider all possible uses, all of the multiple uses in which wilderness, watershed management, and wildlife management are included. If we somehow preclude a hard release principle in any language, wil derness somehow will be denied the ordinary consideration the Forest Service must give in a careful planning process. I believe the protection of Idaho&#39;s wilderness lands deserves care ful thinking. Any legislation which mandates radical change must be opposed. Idaho&#39;s public lands deserve first-class protection; any thing else would be unacceptable. Thank you.",,RUSSELL A.

I&#39;m an oilfield worker from Driggs, Idaho, and we spent quite a bit of work here     opposing a 7.3-mUlion-acre wilderness in Idaho here. We feel that wilderness doesn&#39;t really need any defense. We be lieve in wilderness for its own fate, and one of our major concerns is PC diversity and the preservation of it. And that&#39;s about all I have to say.","The Chairman. Thank you very much. There are several of you
who have spoken of the release language question, hard release,
soft release. Ms. Cavell, I think you were the first witness to talk
about that; what do you understand those terms to mean?
Ms. Cavell. It is to my understanding that the hard release lan
guage would indicate that no further decision would be made on
wilderness in the future, and that, as I mentioned in my testimony,
future generations of children and my children would not have the
opportunity to have a direction in those decisions. On the soft re
lease, it would still leave those areas somewhat open.
The Chairman. Mr. Brown, you addressed hard release in specif
ic terms. I think there were two or three others who mentioned
about it. Pete, didn&#39;t you
Mr. Cole. Yes; I did.
The Chairman. You questioned hard release, soft release; what
do the terms mean to you?
Mr. Cole. Again, release language deals with how are you going
to handle wilderness classifications, whether it&#39;s a potential con
flict, for instance. In Palisades area it was mentioned. And I men
tioned logically that when you have this problem and the fact that
you cannot make wilderness, that to do it at one time precludes
either the positve aspects from the wilderness standpoint or from a
resource development standpoint. So hard release says that you&#39;re
going to make one decision and no more; that once you have decid
ed what is going to be wilderness, the rest of the land is going to be
open for, quote, &#39;multiple-use management.&#39;
In contrast, a soft release statement says that this land may not
be approved for wilderness classification at this point in time, but
it still has wilderness values, and the resource development values
have not been demonstrated. It should therefore not be decided
that this point in time until a better evaluation can be made, such
as the regular forest plans evaluation.
The Chairman. You&#39;re not talking about further study area?
Mr. Cole. And I am talking about further study areas be
cause

The Chairman. Are you or are you not?
Mr. Cole. I am as far as the release language. I use that term
because that is what is appropriate now. We have a further study
area which says that nothing will be&#39; done until further evaluation.
The Chairman. Are you suggesting that all areas that are not
classified as wilderness be placed in further study?
Mr. Cole. If the resource development cannot be demonstrated,
that is my position.
The Chairman. And whose task is it to demonstrate the resource
value?
Mr. Cole. That has to do with when the Forest Service does their
evaluation, reevaluation of wilderness areas at a regular, it is at
that point in time, then, that the resource people and the wilder
ness people should demonstrate their
The Chairman. So it would remain in study status until the
forest planning process would be completed; is that correct?
Mr. Cole. Yes, sir, that is correct.
The Chairman. Under your suggestion?

617




Mr. Cole. Yes, sir; that is correct.
The Chairman. Mr. Brown, you say that â€” you used the Wyoming

deal as an example and say that hard release could prohibit the
Forest Service, and so on, as you stated in your statement. Do you
perceive that the so-called hard release language modifies or re
peals the provisions of the Forest Management Act?
Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.
The Chairman. If it were clear that it did not, would you object?
Mr. Brown. Well, there&#39;s an inherent contrast because the lan
guage in the Wyoming bill states, and I quote, &#39;National Forest
Lands not identified as wilderness shall be managed for multiple
uses other than wilderness,&#39; very specifically. In our view that pre
sents it from sort of a Sophie&#39;s choice of wilderness, right now
today or certainly this year.
Those lands which are not identified for wilderness in Idaho in
proposed or possible legislation would be barred from future wilder
ness consideration in the planning process and would be barred
from even management. And testimony before Senator Watt indi
cated that that would pose a great conflict because it would bar â€”
might perhaps bar management in terms of wildlife protection and
watershed protection.
So we think that hard release is dangerous because it&#39;s all or
nothing; it is indeed a Sophie&#39;s choice and that&#39;s why we&#39;re getting
such opposition to it.
The Chairman. Mr. Cole, you mentioned that wilderness area
was designated; could it be redesignated by future acts of Congress?
Mr. Cole. Yes, sir, they could be released.
The Chairman. Now, isn&#39;t it also true that wilderness areas not
now designated for wilderness can be added to wilderness later by
acts of Congress?
Mr. Cole. Yes, that&#39;s my understanding.
The Chairman. I think we have a semantic difference, a differ
ence of understanding the some words. I asked these questions
about hard release, soft release because I&#39;m really groping for what
it is that people are objecting to in a decision that says, for now
this is our decision about what should be in wilderness and the bal
ance will be managed under the Forest Management Act and
under the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act. How do those â€” those
are our existing laws and it would seem to me that that&#39;s a reason
able compromise, but perhaps that compromise isn&#39;t acceptable to
some. I would hope that this language could be drafted until next
year providing that this language does meet and yield to ambigu
ities that some people have raised.
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for your testimony.
I would understand that our witness list is in error, or at least a
number of you who are supposed to be here that aren&#39;t here. Mr.
Conroy, Mr. McGee, Mr. Kimball, Mr. Alland, Mr. King, and Mr.
Peterson, I understand, are not here; is that correct?
.
The Chairman. And I think Mr. Zerza has a substitute; is that
also correct?
.
Mr. Chairman. All right. We hope that those on panel No. 5
have taken their seats, and I see some are.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Randy Foutch and I represent the Anschutz Corp. We are owners in undi vided issues of oils and gases in the Palisades area, and I would like to briefly address the oil and gas potential of the Palisades area.     The Overthrust Belt has been mentioned several times this morning that it extends from Alaska into at least Mexico, all the way across the Western United States. The only substantial pro duction of oil and gas production in the U.S. Overthrust is in the southern thrust area of Wyoming and Utah. It&#39;s basically in a very unique geological setting, that is very limited, in an area extending something on the order of the magnitude of 50 miles long and 10 miles wide. This production is substantial. â€¢ The Anschutz Corp. believes that the Palisades area may have the very same unique set of geological characteristics. Three things leading for oil and gas production on traps: Something to trap accu mulation, the source, and a seal on top of the trap. Traps are just almost everywhere in the Overthrust all across the Western United States.  The source in the UP strip, the southern area, is basically creta ceous sediment and the seal is basically also cretaceous sediment. The Palisades area that exists has the same set of cretaceous source rocks, it has the same basic seal, and it has the same overth rust package of sediment called Absaroka, which has tremendous potential for reservoir rock. There have been some activity in the Palisades area but these were drilled, if my memory serves me right, more than 10 years ago. One of them, however, did have en couraging on-gas shows. It is our belief that the Palisades area is similar in geological area to this Wyoming-Utah portion of the Overthurst, which does have substantial oil and gas production. Thank you.","Thank you very much. The materials attached to

R. Simplot Co",,,m,"MINERAL AND CHEMICAL DIVISION, J. R SIMPLOT CO. Mr. Moore. Thank you. I&#39;m testifying today on behalf of the J.  R. Simplot Co.&#39;s minerals and chemical division, which is headquar tered in Pocatello, Idaho, and employs more than 2,500 individuals in Idaho and other Western States. This division of the Simplot Co. is engaged in the production and distribution of agricultural fertilizers which are used as crop nutri ents throughout the West and Midwest. Clearly, the reason we are able to manufacture fertilizer prod ucts in Idaho is the availability of phosphate rock. It is a resource key to our existence as a fertilizer producer; and, by the way, phos phorus is an element essential to life itself. The Simplot Co. is in the process of developing a new phosphate mine in the Smoky canyon area of Caribou County in southeast Idaho. This mine, which will come on line next year, will provide the resource base essential for our long-term survival as a viable fertilizer producer. Ore from Smokey Canyon will be transported through an under ground slurry pipeline 26 miles to the existing railhead at Conda, Idaho. The mine and much of the pipeline is located on national forest land. This project, we think, is an ideal example of the multiple-use concept. Environmental research started at the site 5 years in ad vance of mining operations. Not only was ecological date collected, it was evaluated and carefully considered in designing the mine and the mined land reclamation plan. The project, located in a remote, esthetically pleasing area, will demonstrate that it is entirely possible to put our public lands to     625  productive and beneficial use without permanent harm to scenic and recreational values. Based at least in part on this, it is difficult for us to understand the wisdom in placing any additional acreage in a system which es sentially rules out all use. Those relatively few individuals with the inclination, health, and stamina to avail themselves of a formal wilderness experience have ample opportunity to do so in the 3.8 million acres in Idaho alone, already classified as wilderness. Please keep in mind that minerals are a hidden resource. Only sophisticated, thorough exploration techniques will identify and define an ore deposit of economic significance. That type of explo ration simply will not occur on wilderness land. Furthermore, lower grade mineral deposits which cannot be mined under present market conditions may very well be needed by this country in future years due to economic or technological changes. Wilderness designation effectively prohibits the location and development of such deposits. It is the position of the J. R. Simplot Co. that no acreage should be added to Idaho&#39;s existing wilderness system and that, by con gressional action, all designated roadless areas in national forest lands within Idaho&#39;s boundaries should be permanently returned to multiple-use management.

We recognize the importance of wilderness as a valued recre ational resource in our growing tourist industry. Available wilder ness is an important factor in attracting people to work in Idaho. We also recognize the values of wilderness for traditional multipleuse activities: Watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and rangeland. Wilderness has added values for scientific research and artis tic inspiration. We feel roadless areas offer these same multiple-use activities. Therefore we oppose, including in the legislation, release language that will preclude future wilderness designation for existing road less areas.

Thank you, Senator. My name is Pauline Plaza. I&#39;m a regional representative for the National Audubon Society, a nation al conservation organization with 500,000 members nationwide and 1,200 members in Idaho. We appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today about further designation of wilderness in the State. Establishment of a national forest in Idaho 90 years ago had both local and national significance, and we think that designation of wilderness today also has both local and national significance and  631     international significance, since no other country has a national  wilderness preservation system. This time our chapters are working with Idaho conservationists on areas, acreages, and boundaries of areas to be designated. Our final comprehensive proposal will be out in October, but at this time we endorse at least the endangered wilderness core and about two dozen other areas. The final acreages, as I say, will be out in the fall. These areas protect watershed conditions, water quality in fisher ies, maintain wildlife habitat, and protect the scientific and educa tional values for which wilderness is so important. I think from this statement it&#39;s obvious that wilderness is multiple use as multi ple use is defined in the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960. In particular, wilderness leaves natural processes free to act. Phenomena such as insects, viral disease create habitat diversity that supports a full complement of wildlife, including such species as elk, moose, black bear, mountain lion, grizzly, wolf, lynx, gos hawk, golden eagle, and a three-toed woodpecker. According to the 1980 national survey of fishing, hunting, and wildlife-related activities, 50 percent of Idahoans hunt or fish. They spend an average of $450 per year on this activity. Big game hun ters alone spent $234 per year to pursue species such as elk or moose, whose habitat is best managed as wilderness. This is a substantial wildlife-based economy and it&#39;s not even considering the nonconsumptive users who observe, photograph, or otherwise use this wildlife. The lands also returned dollars to the counties as payments in their taxes, so they&#39;re not lost as revenue producers. Timber we see as an apparent conflict with wilderness, not a real conflict because on most sites, particularly in southeastern Idaho, timber production can&#39;t pay for itself. In short term it forms a sub sidy to the timber industry; in the long term it&#39;s a drain on the National Treasury. It increases the national debt; it provides a neg ative return on taxpayers&#39; investment. Costs of sale preparation, road construction, and also future management practices, such as commercial thinning, are usually â€” are far larger than the receipts received.  The Forest Service&#39;s own testimony, their own data that I have looked up in forest planning records and other studies, such as Gloria Helfand's study of the Bighorn-Weitas, indicate this fact very clearly. These kinds of areas with high wildlife and watershed values are much more suited to wilderness management than timber management that would damage the other amended re sources.  Finally, we oppose language in a future bill that would bar lands not now designated as wilderness from reconsideration for wilder ness in future planning cycles. This robs the Forest Service of a valuable management tool and also deprives future generations of this choice. Thank you very much.",,PAULINE D.

Thank you, Senator and panel members and ladies  644  have witnessed restoration procedures in mining today and, along with the general public, find these practices completely acceptable. In fact, using the resources of our land, then restoring the scenic value of that land, it responsible stewardship. Yes, we do care for the environmental aspect of our land. We have pride in the unique beauty of our State. Our State parks ex hibit this every bit as well as national parks. State forests and parks in the east and the south are beautifully managed for the public. They have no lockup of their lands by the Federal Govern     ment.  Wilderness is not an investment in the future as some would have us believe. Not 1 single acre once designated wilderness has ever been returned to multiple use, nor can we see in any of the long-range plans that it ever will be. Rather than putting our re sources in a bank account for future use, it&#39;s like putting them in a vault and sealing it forever. Forever will not benefit the children of Idaho. Areas under consideration for wilderness designation in my dis trict include over a 119,000 acres in the Borah Peak area of Challis National Forest, undetermined acreage in the Italian Peak area northwest of Dubois, as well as over a 168,000 acres in Challis and Salmon National Forests, and most of 450,000 acres along the Mon tana border that would be impacted by the 18-mile wilderness study area. This State faced a financial crises in the wake of loss of expected revenue from timber, mining, and agriculture this past year. How ever, State endowment lands brought in over $6.5 million. We need to be allowed to use all the resources from the land within our State boundaries to meet the needs of the people of Idaho. The people of district 20 support proposal No. 1: No additional wilderness. We agree with Congressman Bob Smith of Oregon and his constituency when in answer to his questionnaire they said, more wilderness? No thanks, by a vote of over 73 percent. A similar survey conducted by Senator Symms shows that 86.7 percent of those answering think Idaho has enough or too much wilderness now. District 20 also brings this message, Senator McClure; 3.8 million acres is more than enough; 20 years of study of roadless areas is more than enough. We ask you kindly to resolve the question in favor of no more wilderness. For the sake of the economic health of Idaho, let our people be free to develop the natural resources of our State.

Good morning, Senator, my name is Larry Svab. I am a senior land man in Shell Oil Co.&#39;s Rocky Mountain division, west  ern exploration and productions. I appreciate this opportunity to appear today and present our views on the management of roadless areas in Idaho&#39;s national forests. Shell believes that the Palisades, West, area of the Targhee Na tional Forest and the Borah Peak area of the Challis National     645  Forest have considerable potential to become hydrocarbon produc ing provinces. Preliminary geological studies are encouraging. They prompt us to conclude that further studies and probes are needed to define the degree of mineral potential these areas offer. I am here principally to support the need for a multiple-use de termination for the Palisades, West, area and the Borah Peak area. We would continue our geologic studies if the Palisades, West, and the Borah Peak area are left open for multiple use, and if oil and gas leases can continually be issued. Shell&#39;s seismic work would employ methods which would not cause significant adverse environmental impacts. I can assure you that Shell is committed to conducting all of its operations in a re sponsible manner that provides adequate environmental safe guards. With the above in mind, Shell&#39;s technical staff is willing to meet privately with the committee to discuss the technical aspects of the Palisades, West, area&#39;s and the Borah Peak&#39;s area mineral poten tial. We offer our expertise in this area to help in your decision making process on this matter. The final comment we have concerns three points we wish to make about the drafting of the language for the bill. We feel they should be considered and incorporated into any wilderness bill for Idaho. No. 1, areas should be explored for their mineral potential before being locked away into a highly restricted single-use management description. No. 2, balanced wilderness legislation can only be achieved with a permanent release of lands determined to be unsuitable for wil derness.  No. 3, the continual study of RARE II lands must be terminated, and the legal sufficiency of the RARE II process must be statutori ly affirmed. Shell believes that an area&#39;s subsurface resources can be poten tially as important as an area&#39;s surface resources. Thank you, Sen ator.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator. I represent Wexpro Co., which is a subsidiary of Mountain Fuel Supply Co. Mountain Fuel is the gas utility that serves northern Utah and southwestern Wyoming, and is the largest supplier of energy in Utah. Mountain Fuel is also the company that thought up â€” was the op  erator that began the overthrust group shoot that was responsible for the overthrust exploration which we now know. In that process we&#39;ve been studying the Palisades area for 3 years and have done extensive geophysical and geological work in the area. And in that regard, we would endorse the answer to the statement that has been provided before. I&#39;d like to address a little bit about the potential of the Palisades area as it affects the gas utility. First of all, last spring we began the necessary right-of-way work to bring low cost, clean natural gas     646  service to southeastern Idaho. Unfortunately we were unable to get any interstate pipeline hookup and are looking for domestic gas re serves in Idaho, so that we might move forward with that project. I heard it stated that no exploration has been conducted in the Pali sades area. There&#39;s a simple answer for that; the Sierra Club has brought suit against the Federal Government and others that has stopped that exploration. Let me tell you what our company has found about the Pali sades. Unfortunately the same forces that created those beautiful mountains, we think created an oil and gas trap, similar to what&#39;s found down in the Evanston area. We think this trap contains 1.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and approximately 86.8 million barrels of oil. What that means is this: If you take 375,127 dwell ings in Idaho, as per the 1980 census, the Palisades field by itself would heat all the homes in Idaho for 43 years. If oil and gas is found, according to the mineral leasing act, half of the Federal roy alty would go to the State; therefore, millions, if not billions of po tential dollars could go into the State pockets. I think one of the great misconceptions that the environmental groups would have you believe is that oil and gas exploration is a rate, ruin and ravage operation when it comes to extensive envi ronments. Frankly, that is just not true. Oil and gas industry has proved exploration can be undertaken in sensitive areas and envi ronmentally acceptable manners; you&#39;re not necessarily sacrificing habitat and scenic and wilderness values. I&#39;d like to show you a picture of a well in Clear Creek Field. I picked this particular picture because it&#39;s on top of a mountain, it&#39;s in Carbon County, Utah; it was drilled in 1966. This picture was taken by Mr. Rodney Smith of U.S. Geological Survey. That same hilltop was again photographed in September 1974, by Mr. Paul W. Burchell, petroleum engineer with the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining, shown almost complete rehabilitation. We have found that that is true. There is drilling being done by Getty and by others in the Jackson Hole area, the Sierra Club has been involved with this and given their approval; and although the well was dry, the rehabilitation is almost complete. Let me summarize it this way. As a public utility and as an ex ploration company, we need the reserves that are there. Thank you, Senator.","Thank you very much.

Thank you, Senator. My name is Douglas Bean, execu  tive director of the Idaho Petroleum Council, a division of the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association. Our basic position is, that with 3.8 million acres in Idaho already under permanent wilderness classification, that&#39;s adequate, that&#39;s enough, and no more is necessary or needed. As one spokesman said Tuesday at the Boise hearing, you can&#39;t feed your family or educate your kids with a lot of beautiful sce nery. Industries, which recommend no more wilderness or very lim  647  ited additions, are the backbone of the State&#39;s economy, the produc ers, the creators of job opportunities, the sources of tax revenues, for Federal, State, and local governments. A point I want to stress is that my industry believes strongly in adequate wilderness and roadless areas. We recognize clearly there are lands which are sensitive and unique, which qualify for special management and protection. Yet, it is a proven fact that we can have both orderly develop ment of oil and gas resources and maintenance of fragile and sensi tive areas. That&#39;s been proven so many times in national forests, national wildlife refuges, and sanctuaries, it&#39;s just indisputable. The enourmous amount of acreage under lease or application in forests in region 4 of eastern and southern Idaho underscores in dustry&#39;s belief that there is high oil and gas potential in this area, in spite of the comments you heard from a political science profes sor, from Idaho State University, this morning trying to masquer     ade as a geologist.  In southwestern Wyoming and Northeastern Utah, just a few miles from Idaho&#39;s borders, a billion barrels of oil and several tril lion cubic feet of natural gas have been discovered in the Overthrust Belt just in the last 8 years. Discoveries in Idaho would seem to be only a matter of time, and we should be doing everything possible to encourage more explora tion. America cannot run without oil, and the more homegrown oil we can find, why, the safer and more secure the energy future of the country is. I submit that the areas â€” an area&#39;s subsurface resources are po tentially as important and valuable as the surface features. If min eral resources are unknown, then a major, critical component to sound decisionmaking is lacking. Oil and gas exploration and production are essentially a nonde structive use of land, while widespread preservation and lockup is an economically destructive nonuse of public lands. The most critical component, though, of any balanced wilderness legislation is language for the permanent release of lands deter mined to be unsuitable for wilderness classification. We strongly urge that the Idaho wilderness bill incorporate permanent release and legal sufficiency language. This is the only fair approach be cause since wilderness designation is permanent, nonwilderness designation also should be equally permanent.

I&#39;m substituting for Richard Hughes. My name is Dean Moses; I work for Atlantic Richfield Co. Atlantic Richfield is primarily a domestic producer of oil and gas; therefore, we are very concerned with the management of our Nation&#39;s public lands. We believe it is essential for the Idaho dele gation to decide on a wilderness proposal which will provide for a balance of multiple uses. Atlantic Richfield Co. is not opposed to the concept of wilderness. On the contrary, we recognize that wil derness lands are an important part of our Nation&#39;s heritage. We do not believe, however, that lands containing energy and mineral potential should be designated as wilderness. It is imperative that priority consideration be given to mineral exploration in those areas which contain potential for energy reserves before a longterm decision, such as wilderness is made. Atlantic Richfield Co. believes that areas should be explored for energy and mineral po tential prior to permanent placement in a highly restrictive singleuse management prescription, wilderness. With regard to specific areas, Atlantic Richfield is particularly  concerned with the Mount Naomi further planning and Worm Creek recommended wilderness areas. Despite what I heard earlier this morning on the Idaho Overthrust, anyone who fully under stands geology and geophysics realizes that it takes time to develop a viable prospect. We are just beginning a long-range exploration plan involving surface and subsurface geological evaluations in this part of Idaho and Utah. We believe this area has similar structural features as the main producing trend of the Overthrust Belt. As a result, we are committed to spending more than $800 thousand this year on a seismic program which covers a regional 40 mile line di rectly south of Mount Naomi. Worm Creek and Mount Naomi are directly on trend with this line. Mount Naomi&#39;s southern boundary lies within 10 miles of our regional seismic program. We believe that our willingness to spend such considerable funds, as well as time and effort, on this project should be taken into consideration during your deliberations on wilderness. In addition, we support permanent release of those areas deter mined not suitable for wilderness designation. One of the most crit ical factors in making a balanced wilderness decision is providing for the permanent placement of areas determined to be unsuitable for wilderness designation. Lands placed in wilderness remain so in perpetuity until Congress determines otherwise. It seems only fair and reasonable that lands unsuitable for wilderness be returned to multiple-use management in perpetuity until Congress determines otherwise. Atlantic Richfield Co. would like to thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to present our views here today, and we commend you for holding these public hearings prior to drafting the actual wil derness legislation itself. Thank you.","Thank you very much.

Yes; thank you. I am public lands coordinator for     Conoco. My testimony in Boise described why my company needed hard release language for our long-term investment security. I&#39;d like to switch to another subject today on the compatibility of our oil and gas operations with sensitive environments. You have heard a lot in these hearings and you will continue to hear because our oil work is irreparably damaging wilderness withdrawals essen tial to protection of it. However, as Mr. Gill has testified on the proven ability to rehabilitate, it simply does not bear out that argu ment. I&#39;ll start with a story on Senate bill 2801, the wilderness bill last year. During hearings on that bill chaired by Senator McClure, we  heard the vice president of the Audubon Society describe to the Senate the awful consequences of oil activities on Federal lands. And you probably know that the Audubon also owns a number of wildlife refuges on private lands, and on those private refuges they encourage oil exploration and production. The royalty revenue is important to the work of the society. The oil operations are careful ly controlled to be in harmony with the wildlife environment, and we have no great problems with that. A few days after I heard the Audubon testimony describing these terrible effects, our exploration manager was called to the Audu bon&#39;s offices to see how we could expedite work on a private lease that we held from them in Louisiana. Today we are drilling on that lease. I hope we do find oil and so does Audubon. It&#39;s just multiple use at its best, a true case of eating your cake and having it too. This is not an attack on the Audubon for appearing to have double standards, but rather a caution to Congress to look carefully at ex aggerated claims of incompatibility. Conoco, like others, seeks to be on the cutting edge of science. A part of that is our improved and improving ability to treat the land gently while havesting its resources. We have operated an oil field for 50 years in the Federal Wildlife Refuge at Aransas Pass; that&#39;s a fragile home to 22 endangered species. The magnificent whooping crane winters there amongst our pumps, pipelines, and oil field equipment. We are fortunate to have this living, striking testimony to coexistence because under today&#39;s restrictions we probably would not have had the opportunity to enter those lands. A few years ago, we drilled a dry hole near Gray&#39;s Lake, a highly sensitive environmental area southeast of here. We met all the con ditions to operate with no harm whatsoever to the fragile surface and wildlife resources. We are but one of several companies who have explored and drilled eastern Idaho, and we have a continuing interest to explore and drill more. It would be tragic indeed to deny Idaho&#39;s industry future on the alleged, but misinformed, basis of in compatibility.  657  I recall a quote attributed to Mark Twain. Upon reading of his death, accidently posted in the obituaries, Mark Twain wrote back, &#39;The recent reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.&#39; You have heard many claims of incompatibility during these hearings, and like Mark Twain&#39;s death, they are very greatly exag gerated. We hope you will remember this when you return to Washington to write our bill. On a personal basis I might say that I am an active user of the wilderness. I have enjoyed the mountains, the forests, hiking, and backpacking in the wilderness, and I expect to continue to visit the wildernesses in the future. However, I hope â€” thank you.","Thank you.

Senator and staff, I welcome the opportunity to  speak to you today regarding an issue very important to my center of living and my way of life. I am Marie Bailey and I represent Idaho Women in Timber. We are an organization of women and men involved in Idaho&#39;s timber industry. We are loggers, office per sonnel, mill people, foresters, and concerned citizens who derive our livelihoods directly from the forest. Idaho Women in Timber is dedicated to both a quality environ ment and a healthy timber industry. We do not think it is a ques tion of either/or but a matter of striking a viable balance. The Idaho forest is a complex resource comprising of land, plants, water, air, wildlife, and equally as important, people. It needs care ful, thoughtful management to assure a stable economy. Idaho Women in Timber is an organization pledged to increase communication, promote constructive legislation, and encourage education as it relates to the timber industry in Idaho. The Federal Government, especially the Forest Service, is Idaho&#39;s largest forest landlord. Timber harvest levels on national forest lands are shrinking. Since 1930 almost one-fourth of the national forest land in Idaho, capable of growing crops of trees, has been placed in a limited-use classification, such as wilderness and primi tive areas. The national forests are vital to the country&#39;s wood supply. They contain 46 percent of all the Nation&#39;s soft wood grow ing stock; that is, the wood must used in housing construction and for pulp and paper. With tens of millions of acres of national forest land frozen for years during RARE I and RARE II, the timber supply in the West is becoming critical. Uncertainty over the land base available for timber has put many mills and communities on a hand-to-mouth basis. As long as more land, capable of growing crops of trees, are put aside, hundreds of communities and thou sands of workers live in uncertainty. Capital improvements for mills are risky, and counties face severe tax problems, especially if mill closures occur. The consequences of this local and regional un certainty is felt throughout the State. Idaho&#39;s forest products indus try is basic to the State&#39;s economic well-being. The timber industy employes 20,000 people directly and many communities are totally dependent upon the timber industry payroll to support their serv ices and retail businesses.     658  In addition, 25 percent of the national forest receipts from timber sales are devoted to helping finance Idaho&#39;s schools and road system. In 1979, the most recent good business year for the timber industry, the Forest Service contribution to the countries in the State alone totaled $9 million. Roadless areas are not wilderness and are generally no different than the 10 million acres of national forest that have been man aged for multiple uses, including timber. For one reason or another the timber sales have been placed in other areas and roads have not been constructed. Since the Forest Service future timber sales plans are heavily dependent upon timber within the nonselected roadless areas, the controversy must be resolved, both to assure a sound timber industry in Idaho and to assure the other valid uses, including wilderness and timber production. What do we do when the wilderness becomes aggressive? The Mountain Pine Beetle has killed billions of cubic feet of good timber in the Targhee National Forest. On land owned by the timber industry, infested trees are being salvaged as they become infested or cut before infestation. State lands and private ranches, which are run for profit, see relatively few problems from the beetle. What problems there are stem from the wilderness areas and national parks, which allow the bug a field day. If wilderness could be taken by itself in isolation from the real world, there would be no problem. The trouble is wilderness areas do not exist in isolation; they often border on private land.","Thank you very much for your statement. The
statement will be made part of the record and the attachments will

I am Jay Dopp and I represent Lumber Production industrial Workers Local 1117 in St. Anthony,  Idaho. We support Federal legislation to resolve the wilderness issue in Idaho. We definitely are in favor of immediate congressional action to settle the Idaho wilderness issue once and for all. We feel that this issue has been dragged on far too long now for anyone&#39;s good. We also feel that there is far too much land in these roadless study areas that are being considered for wilderness. In fact, many of these areas that are set aside for study really don&#39;t have any unique or rare quality that would or should place them into a wil derness category. There are some areas, however, in the study that are truly beautiful wilderness, and we do not want to see them dis turbed. We are all environmentalists in a sense, but we must use commonsense when it comes to determining what should be placed into wilderness and what should be placed into multiple use. So let&#39;s get these issues settled. Get the wilderness that is wilderness set aside where it belongs and the rest put back into multiple use and man aged properly. If we just try to work together a little harder, I am sure this issue can be settled in a way that is satisfactory to every one.  Thank you.","Thank you very much for your statement. I wish

Senator Mr. Chairman, I&#39;ll be very brief. I don&#39;t have any questions to ask the panel right now. I appreciate all the wit nesses that have testified and those who will. And I apologize to you, Mr. Chairman, that I was not able to be here when you start  ed this morning; however, I had a commitment at the other end of the State and couldn&#39;t get here any sooner. But I think that you certainly deserve our commendations for having these hearings and allowing all Idahoans an opportunity to speak to this issue. And I&#39;ll just also say that I hope that these hearings â€” I agree with the last speaker, I hope that these hearings will mark the last  in many chapters of this wilderness question in the State of Idaho. We have studied it and studied and studied it, and I think it&#39;s worthwhile for us to note that we have 3.8 million of legislative and protected wilderness. That&#39;s almost 10 percent of all the lands in Idaho if you add in those RARE II lands that are now managed as wilderness. One-sixth of the Government land and full 25 per cent of the Forest Service land is already in the wilderness state presently, so we clearly have more than any State in the Union. And I would hope that when this set of hearings is over, that you  664     as chairman will have a fairly good feeling of how much additional acreage should be designated to wilderness in Idaho, if any, and were the RARE II studies sufficient to meet the policy require  Policy Act, and should ments of the National Environmental Idaho&#39;s RARE II bill include language that will release the land for multiple use that has been studied but rejected for the wilderness designation. When we were with you in Boise the other day, I could see that you have a very broad range of opinion on those questions, but I think those are things that we have to address in the Congress. I would hope that all the constituents in the State would recognize the problem that Chairman McClure has in trying to get a happy meeting place between these diverse points of view. I&#39;m trying to go into these things with a broad, wide open opinion of what we should do, but I can&#39;t help but mention, I think, that when I hear witnesses testify about the potential for oil and gas in this part of the world, that it would be much better in the long run for us to improve our technology and to improve our ability to have side-byside relationship between all interests of energy production and mineral production and the great outdoors than it would be to be sending our sons off to the Persian Gulf or some other place, the Caribbean Basin, to fight over very critical minerals or oil and gas. So I hope that some resolution of this can be made, and I think we should pay heed to the fact that Idaho already is a State that has made a large contribution to the Nation&#39;s wilderness reserve and that we don&#39;t have to take a back seat to anyone in terms of how much we have. I think there&#39;s about 4 acres of wilderness for each person living in the State right now, which is a considerable amount of land when you view it in terms of other parts of the world. So I look forward to the remaining part of this hearing and then the other two hearings you&#39;ll be having throughout the State, and I again say, I appreciate you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing Idahoans the opportunity to have their input to this important deci sion that we have to make.

Senator McClure, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Clark Collins. I am president of the Idaho Trail Machines Asso     665  ciation. On behalf of the over 500 members of the Idaho Trail Ma chine Association and estimated 25,000 off-road motorcyclists of Idaho, I would like to address this hearing on the proposed Idaho wilderness bill. The wilderness controversy has been erroneously portrayed by many as a recreation versus development issue. Motorized recrea tion has been ignored by those taking this stand, and speaking as a representative of the trail bike riders of Idaho, we cannot support any additions to what is already the second largest wilderness area of any State in the Union. We have proven our responsibility by our many years of coopera tion with our public land managers. Through our membership in the Idaho Trails Council, we have demonstrated our willingness to share the trails with other users. We have, in fact, been honored by that organization for the hundreds of miles of trails cleared annu ally by ITMA members. These trail improvements and use of State parks and recreation ORV funds benefit all users and assist our land managers, enabling them to maintain a larger trail system than would otherwise be possible. The majority of Idaho trails suffer from a lack of use and maintenance rather than overuse by trail riders. Multiple-use management has in the past represented conserva tion and the balanced use of our natural resources. The lands being considered fort wilderness classification are presently being man aged to protect their wilderness values without the restrictions im posed by this Federal designation. We feel the Forest Service is capable of managing these lands without legislative intervention. For those lands that are primarily of recreational value, we would support a less restrictive classifica tion protecting them from commercial exploitations but allowing a broader range of recreational opportunities and less restrictive management requirements. As we see it, the push for more wilderness is not supported by the majority of Idahoans, nor by the State government, nor the Federal land managers, but rather by out of State based, special in terest societies of environmental extremists, the majority of whom have never been to Idaho and never will be. The management by exclusion and discriminatory restrictions imposed by wilderness designation have resulted in the tragic over use of the easily accessible outer edges of these nationally noted areas, and the virtual nonuse and neglect of the majority of these lands. We have thousands of miles of trails in Idaho but not enough so that those seeking a solitary trail experience can be as sured of having their favorite trail all to themselves. We support wilderness; not the artificial Federal land classifica tion but the natural wilderness where there are no manmade land ing strips. There are no trail bikes, not because it is against the law, but because Idaho&#39;s true wilderness will not physically accom modate them. We support opportunities for solitude and natural experience. Those desiring these types of recreation should seek them where they exist rather than attempting to have them legislated into ex istence.  32-426  0â€”84  43  666  We are not asking for a lion&#39;s share of our public lands for our selfish exclusive use. We seek only the opportunity to share these lands with other users. We therefore expect no less consideration from others. Encountering others on the trail should be an oppor tunity to make new friends, not the destruction of a solitary recre ational experience. Prior motorized recreational use of an area should have a bear ing on its suitability for wilderness, if that type of use is to be ex cluded by the designation. That has not been apparent in the past nor has it been allowed in the consideration of this proposed legis lation. We therefore oppose any additions to federally designated wilderness and will present additional written testimony within the time limit, regarding the areas of specific concern to us. Thank you.","Thank you very much.

My name is Kathy Schwalm and I represent Out doors Unlimited, Inc., Sawtelle Chapter, and I appreciate the op  portunity to testify at this hearing. We are a group of outdoors men and women in eastern Idaho who depend on the Federal lands for our livelihood; we use Federal lands for recreational purposes, we have lived in and loved all of Idaho lands in many cases for generations. I do not want to reiterate all the facts and figures that the forest products industry and the livestock industries and the mining in dustries have given you. They are true and we agree with them. We are an organization that has proposed the multiple use of public lands since the first wilderness activist began proposing the lockup of millions of acres of valuable resources. We believe there are many other management tools available to the Federal land managers and that wilderness should be left for the really special areas.  Most of the people that we represent are working folk; therefore, they are not on my mailing list. They are very busy working and so they are not much for joining, going, or signing up. So I have a hard time saying numbers, but there&#39;s a lot of us. We believe that proposing every 5,000 10,000 or 15,000 acre piece of unroaded real estate for wilderness is badly warping Congress original intent of the Wilderness Act. I personally have spend a great deal of time in the Sawtooth Mountains and wilderness areas. I can see why that area would be so designated. But Lionshead and Mount Borah, they are just one big nice mountain. Pretty, yes, in their own way, but so are a lot of others. They are not threatened by any big development like log ging, raining, or oil. The Centenials are fun, they&#39;re wide open, roaded for years, and they&#39;re great for grazing. But wilderness? No. I realize that grazing is allowed in wilderness areas, however it be comes so difficult that it doesn&#39;t make it worth it for the grazers. And if it were, why are the sheep and cattlemen not in favor of more wilderness?     667  It disturbs me that so many think that only great, good quality recreation can take place in wilderness areas. My personal, best ex periences have been in nondesignated areas. I personally am a horseback rider but I&#39;m going to fight for the trail bike rider&#39;s right to recreate in forest areas and outdoor places, because next will be the horse and next will be the human. Threatening an area with the production of a resource such as timber, minerals, or oil is not a good reason to turn an unroaded area into automatic wilderness. The forest lands, that is, Palisades, Mallard-Larkin, were set aside for just that purpose, for the future needs of a growing country- Who decides when that future becomes present? We all assumed it was to be a free market system, not a big government who would decide. The biggest problem in my experience with the designation of wilderness is that it does not really preserve anything. The five designated campgrounds get so overused it&#39;s pitiful, and there become so many rules that it&#39;s almost impossible to have a real oldfashioned outdoor experience. If you really want to preserve our mountain areas, we recommend that some other available manage ment tools, such as natural unroaded areas, closures during parts of the year, and multiple-use principles, be used more extensively. Wilderness, if it truly is wilderness, will preserve itself by its very nature.

My name is Marty Huebner. I&#39;m speaking as a private citizen as a former back country license guide. Senator, most of what we&#39;ve heard today about justifying why we should use the wilderness is based on so-called economic reasons. In my view, many of the facts and figures cited for so-called economic reasons were pretty onesided, dishonest, and misleading. Perhaps without meaning to, most were slanted for the benefit of one indus try or interest group. And if I hear that big lie that wilderness locks up everything one more time, I think I&#39;ll throw up. If we look at the situation absolute honesty, in terms of how we, U.S. taxpayers, fare in nearly every transaction involving public lands, we taxpayers lose money. This is not the land management agencies fault, it&#39;s the Congress because that body has not provided a way for the Government to even recover its costs in multiple-use ventures, much less add a little money to the Treasury.     670  Multiple use of public lands refers to timber, recreation, grazing, water, soils, mining, wildlife, and I could prove, if I had the time, that we taxpayers subsidize them all. We lose money overall on timber sales, as has been mentioned, because all Government costs involved aren&#39;t recovered. We taxpayers get no compensation for use of public lands and water&#39;s free by recreationists like me who use them, and the men and women who harvest fish and wildlife like I do; we get no compensation for that. It&#39;s all for free. We tax payers get no compensation for some waters provided free to cities, agriculture and industry from public lands. We get no compensa tion for the mineral wealth extracted free from public lands by the mining industry, it&#39;s all a big giveaway. And we get about 50 cents on the dollar back from our grazing. As I said, we taxpayers subsidize all multiple use, but since we taxpayers are also part of the communities, industries and interest groups involved, Congress won&#39;t be changing the situation. The only way we can cut Government spending involving these public lands and perhaps help cut down on our horrible national debt in question is to leave them as wildernesses. We didn&#39;t buy wildernesses, we didn&#39;t make wildernesses, we got them free. It&#39;s our duty to leave them in the public trust and mini mize our tax burdens. So much for the economic issues involving wilderness. I agree with the thousands of other men and women and kids in Idaho who hunt and fish, many of them members of the Idaho Wildlife Association, that we keep all wildernesses study areas, Forest Service, and BLM as wilderness, especially the Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core. We must not deviate from the methods Congress has used in the past to methodically and deliberately evaluate and establish wildernesses. The wilderness is patient; the only people really to exploit our public resources are impatient ones who want to get their grubby little hands on it. If the lands are designated for nonwilderness use but then so not used, these lands must be available to be reevaluated as wilderness at some future planning period. In the last year I personally have been on foot in 10 of Idaho&#39;s national forests. I&#39;ve even been to Alaska twice and seen much of their wilderness that everybody talks so much about. Our beautiful and unique Idaho wildernesses are better; let&#39;s keep them as they are.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator McClure, Senators. My name is Jim Sinclair, I&#39;m the Pocatello Chapter representative of the Idaho Conservation League. I am here speaking for myself as well as the ICL. First, I&#39;d like to say that I support the Conservation sportman&#39;s proposal that will be released this fall, and also that my group sup ports the 10 endangered core areas in Idaho for wilderness. Eastern Idaho, probably unlike the rest of Idaho, desperately needs wilder ness.  I am a native of this State and maybe in some ways a typical native. I am quite well traveled and spend a lot of time in some pristine areas around the world and know from my own experience that Idaho takes second seat to none in these beautiful areas.     679  It seems like in these hearings we get so involved in the politics and the economical aspects of talking about all this in terms of our short-term survival, that we forget to ask, you know, maybe, what if we survive, you know, what&#39;s beyond, if we as a group really work out a lot of our problems? Definitely, there&#39;s three areas that are really of concern to me that I would like to point out in southeastern Idaho that are areas that would be key areas, key to recreation areas for high popula tion centers. I also happen to work in a high technology industry, and I&#39;m not affiliated with oil and mineral and logging and timber and that kind of thing. I think I tend to be the wave of the future, especially in Idaho. I think that agriculture and timber and logging and mining are somewhat mature areas, and that there&#39;s going to be a slowdown in growth in the State in these areas, and that what is going to be moving into the State is more areas like â€” or more companies like AMI and Zylog and Hewlett-Packard. And with that is going to bring a slow growth of population, and these people need places to recreate. You know, specifically around the Pocatello area I really would like to point out areas such as West Mink Creek; that it&#39;s only min utes from Pocatello and it&#39;s a watershed from Pocatello and it sup plies an enormous recreational facility to the area. It&#39;s already been selectively logged in the past. It&#39;s a very beautiful area, and it&#39;s a prime example of an area that should be looked at for wilder ness designation.

Hello, my name is Lill Erickson and I am here to testify for my husband, Phil Hearn, as well as myself. I am with  the Idaho Conservation League. I traveled 170 miles to testify here today in support of additional wilderness for Idaho because I think it&#39;s a very important issue, and I had to get up at 4 o&#39;clock this morning so it&#39;s pretty important to me. I am from district 20 and I have to say that Senator Crystal and Representative Wood do not voice my views; I disagree with them and I don&#39;t want you to think that they speak for everyone. I am from Salmon which is rapidly becoming a community eco nomically dependent on recreation. It is the third largest industry in the State exceeded only by agriculture and manufacturing. In 1981 receipts from recreation totaled $1,843,500,000 and is growing, according to the division of economic and community affairs, which is a State office. In contrast, Idaho&#39;s fourth and fifth industries, mining and timber, contributed only $420 million and $342 million respectively, to the State. Recreation is intrinsic to the economic well being of Idaho, and the prosperity of the recreation industry depends on the quality of the water, fish, wildlife and scenic resources of the State. And I don&#39;t agree with some of the other folks who believe that the recre ation industry â€” road recreation industry is the only recreation in dustry. I do appreciate the industry that requires roads, and I  680     think it&#39;s important, but also the wilderness dependent recreation  industry is very important. Wilderness designation protects these natural resources from mismanagement. Emphasis is placed on the noncommodity value and restrictions placed on the exploitation of the commodity re sources of range, timber and minerals. Wilderness is really multi ple use in my feelings. Only roads, construction, timber harvesting, and mechanized equipment are prohibited. The other multiple uses of grazing, hunting, fishing, hiking, and mining are allowed and regulated to compliment and enhance rather than exhaust the nat ural resource character. I ask the committee to designate as wilderness those areas in cluded in the conservationist&#39;s proposal which is being developed. It is being prepared in a careful and thoughtful manner. Field inven tories are being conducted by hundreds of dedicated volunteers and boundaries drawn to exclude resource-use conflicts and protect fragile areas. I am confident that the proposal will recommend only those areas of the highest wilderness caliber. Personally, I recommend the Northern Lemhis, the Idaho side of the West Big Hole, Germania Creek, the White Clouds, and Boul der Mountains and Mount Borah, which are near Salmon. I also endorse the Sawtooth completions, Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest, the Mallard-Larkins, the Payette Crest, Garns Mountains, the Palisades, the Great Burn and Cayuse Creek and the SalmoPriest. I further ask because of my particular feeling for the White Clouds that a no mining clause be inserted to forever protect the White Clouds from mineral development. I think the resource value of wilderness there far exceeds any mineral value. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues and I enjoyed hearing Senator Symms&#39; 5-minute testimony on his wilderness views.","Thank you.

Mr. Thank you, Senator McClure, for this opportunity to testify before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee     on proposed wilderness in Idaho. My name is Tom Geary. I am the vice president of the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation, a farmer and a rancher from the Burley area. I am speaking on behalf of the Idaho Farm Bureau Federa  tion which is the largest farm organization in the State represent ing over 22,000 families throughout the State. Farm Bureau has long been on record as an advocate for the wise use and development of America&#39;s national resources. As a result of this philosophy we are opposed to the concept of locking up land by designating it as wilderness. As you are all well aware, Idaho has in excess of 3.8 million acres already locked up by this designation. This represents more acres than any other State in the Union, except Alaska. We have several concerns that are brought up by the prospects of having additional land in Idaho placed into wilderness, and I would like to touch, briefly, on a couple of these today. First, we are concerned that the Forest Service will have several land management options removed. In Idaho, as in other farming States, noxious weeds are a very costly problem to the farming community. Wilderness areas become breeding grounds for weeds with the Forest Service unable to do any control. Control of forestkilling insects is also removed as in all vegetative manipulation, which is used to improve range conditions that benefit all animals on national forests, wild and domestic. The development of water that is beneficial to livestock and wildlife becomes difficult, if not impossible. We are also concerned about the curtailment of preda tor control in wilderness areas. Second, as you are well aware, the United States is very depend ent on other countries for our supplies of strategic minerals as well as gas and oil. The countries that we are dependent upon are in regions of the world that are very unstable and we could find supply lines cut rather suddenly. The potential for these materials, as well as gas and oil, are just beginning to be explored in the east ern part of our State covered by the national forests you are taking testimony on today. These natural resources need to be expanded and developed in an orderly fashion where concern for the environ ment will be looked after and the land protected. Whereas, if we  686  lock these lands up until we find our supplies cut, our fear is that great environmental damage would occur in the rush to find and develop these resources in the interest of national security. In short, we feel that wilderness designation would have a detri mental effect, both from a local prospective as well as a national one. Wilderness is not wise management of our natural resources and would not be in the best interest of the citizens of Idaho or the Nation as a whole. Thank you, Senator.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator McClure. I appreciate this opportunity to testify on this occasion. And my stand is that  32-426  0â€” 84  46  698     I&#39;m opposed to any further designation of wilderness in the great State of Idaho. We need to look at the future of our economic situa  tion. Idaho has already contributed 3,825,900 acres of national forest to the National Wilderness Preservation System, and an additional 1,035,600-plus acres that have been recommended for wilderness classification, and has another 630,924 acres being studied for possi ble designation as wilderness. Over 2 million additional acres of BLM land that has been recommended â€” or is being studied for rec ommendation as wilderness. Idaho has experienced job losses and deletion of its resource base due to wilderness classification and continuing wilderness studies. We need development of our resources â€” timber, minerals, grazing, to assure a tax base for education and job security for future gen erations. I&#39;ve been a victim of over-regulation and abuse of our resource development by Federal legislation, and I&#39;d like to tell you by expe rience. I used to own a ranch out of West Yellowstone, Mont., and when I purchased the ranch we had considerable grazing rights and permits with that ranch, and the Forest Service assured me that they wouldn&#39;t cut those permits and allotments because there was plenty of vegetation and grazing available. Well, I went on for a few years and finally they notified me that they were going to cut my allotments. I asked them, why, because there was plenty of feed there that was going to waste, so much grass that it was a fire hazard and there was just no need to cut grazing. The forest ranger looked me in the eye and he said, Mr. Williams, this is a recreation area; all we want is enough grazing here to make it look picturesque, just enough cattle to make it look picturesque. It really threw me for a loss, because any cut in that allotment was detrimental. There wasn&#39;t enough rights there to make a living anyway. So, I feel that we can over-legislate. We can lock up the areas that need to be redeveloped and that we need to look to the future generations. This State is large enough for plenty of recreation and resource mineral, timber development as it is. Thank you.","Thank you very much, Senator; I appreciate

Thank you, Senator. I&#39;m Rod Parker, employee of the department of fish and game. I appreciate the opportunity to present the views of the Fish and Game Commission on the re maining roadless areas of Idaho and potential wilderness legisla tion. The position of the Idaho Fish and Game Commission is that roadless areas having highly significant fish, wildlife, or hunting and fishing values should be classified as wilderness if wilderness is the best means fo protecting those values. Our recommendations to this committee on the Forest Service RARE II recommendations of 1979 and for a possible State wilderness bill are essentially the same. Review of our 1979 position did not result in recommending any additional roadless areas for wilderness. However, the past 4 years have seen additional instances where fish and wildlife values have been diminished by construction of roads into previously unroaded areas, strengthening our conviction that the few remaining areas with exceptionally high fish or wildlife values must have wil derness classification to retain these qualities. In the national forests emphasized at this particular hearing, the commission specifically recommends the roadless areas designated as Borah Peak in the Challis National Forest. This area is that seg ment of the Big Lost River Range between Double Springs Pass near Dickey and Pass Creek Summit near Leslie. It is a unique subalpine unit superimposed on a high desert environment with little or no transitional zoning. Two bighorn sheep releases were  700     made in the 1960&#39;s resulting in a population which now numbers approximately 200. It is ideal bighorn habitat and ancestrally sup ported a large population. It also supports a remnant mountain  goatherd and substantial deer and elk populations. The lower ele vations also support antelope. Specific recommendations for wilderness areas in the other na tional forests will be or have been presented by other members of the Idaho Fish and Game Commission at hearings held at the other locations in Idaho. The recommendations statewide are for 11 roadless areas or por tions thereof which total 558,782 acres. The commission also takes the position that any State wilderness bill should not included the so-called hard release wording. Road less areas not classed as wilderness should come under the ongoing planning process fo the various national forests and considered for allocation to one of the many nonwilderness forest management prescriptions. This is extremely important for fish and wildlife resources, be cause there are a number of prescriptions that retain roadless characteristics without the necessity of legislative wilderness classi fication. However, when plans are revised in the future, wilderness should be available as an option if roadless status has not proved adequate.  Therefore, if release wording prohibits future considerations of wilderness classification, the commission then recommends that certain roadless areas listed by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game be assigned to the separate category of further planning as outlined under the RARE II procedures. Mr. Chairman, the commission has judiciously considered the State&#39;s remaining roadless areas and the implications of a State wilderness bill. The selected few areas which are endorsed for wil derness bill. The selected few areas which are endorsed for wilder ness classification have strong justification based on extremely im portant fish, wildlife, or hunting and fishing values.

Thank you, Mr. Senator. I am not a native of Idaho; I&#39;ve only been here about 4 years. I was raised in Cleveland, Ohio, and that s the place, you might recall, where the river caught on fire about 15 years ago and burned a bridge down. So, I think I can at least appreciate somewhat the proper use of land and water resources.  I am speaking to you today on behalf of the Upper Snake River Chapter of Trout Unlimited, of which I am the president. It&#39;s a con tribution organization, I admit. We believe that part of our objec     701  tives are to commit ourselves to maintain and improving where possible the health of our fresh water resources. It is our belief that healthy aquatic and riparian life are symbols of environmen tal qualities, proof that our fresh water resources are healthy. It is to this end that our objectives are aimed. Some of the objectives in clude working with State and Federal fisheries, supporting enact ment of laws, et cetera, and also protecting salmonoid habitat by encouraging integrated watershed management, supporting good forestry and agricultural practices, and advocating intelligent land development. It is in response to these objectives that I am here today. I would first like to agree with any multiple-use proponent that a large part of the remaining wild lands need not be protected as wil derness. There are, however, many land areas, some of which have been mentioned, that are critical to wildlife, as well as important to the quality of streams and wild fish populations in addition to being valuable for wilderness recreation. I am first and foremost urging caution in designating lands for multiple use where the ef fects of such designation may result in habitat degradation that has not been fully studied. As for specifics, we would recommend at the very minimum the 1983 Wilderness Recommendations by the Idaho Fish and Game Department. They are summarized in appendix A that I have in cluded in my written testimony. I would like to summarize some of these areas now. Clearwater National Forest area, this encompasses the Kelly Creek Watershed, which is, needless to say, near and dear to the hearts of many fishermen, not only in Idaho, but in other areas of the country. The 1979 Forest Service proposal excluded two road less areas critical to the protection of this watershed. One area in volves Cayuse Creek, and the other is situated between Moose Mountain, in the Lower Kelly Creek, and they are designated as Q1.301 upstream. We would strongly urge wilderness classification for these two roadless areas in addition to the areas recommended by the Forest Service. Kelly Creek is being managed as a catch and release fishery and is an area that provides large westslope and cutthroat trout. Also present in this area are numerous other wild life species which can be protected by wilderness classification. The Challis National Forest, Borah Peak, the Sawtooth Moun tain area, as well as the Northern Lemhis, also we feel are certain ly appropriately designated as wilderness areas.",,FLOYD J.

My name is Carl Atamanczyk. I&#39;m president of Idaho Falls Trail Machine Association, one of five chapters in the State. Our organization is about 20 years old. As a nonprofit, con servation, and service-oriented group, the Idaho Trail Machine As sociation agrees that our wilderness areas are endangered from many sources. We feel, however ironically, one of the main threats     comes from the very environmental movement seeking to protect it. Efforts to preserve pieces of land in their natural state go back nearly a century, but they received their greatest impetus when Congress adopted the Wilderness Act of 1964. Since then, more than 15 million acres have been classified as wilderness, an area  larger than Delaware, Maryland, and Massachusetts combined. Also, since the 1964 act, we have had ample time to determine which areas are most suitable for real wilderness and which areas we can properly manage and still allow for multiple use. Also, as a family oriented trail bike association, we realize the great importance to protect fragile areas as wilderness. We do not support the rape, ravage, ruin, and run philosophy. But we do be lieve strongly in using the natural resources so abundant on and under our public lands, and in having our lands open to varied types of recreational activities for all types of users, not just a few selfish groups. Three years ago Congress considered wilderness classification for another 15 million acres in the lower 48 States and 70 million in Alaska. This is an area equal to all of New England, plus Pennsyl vania, Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey. The economic arguments against wilderness designation are well known. They lock up the land resources that can&#39;t be used. Miner als go unmined, crops go unplanted, livestock is barred from rangeland, and trees are allowed to rot and die. In some parts of wilder ness areas the Government lets forest fires burn. Enough timber to build thousands of homes can be wasted in just one fire like that. They sometimes smolder for months on end before dying out natu rally, but the Government reasons that since no one fought forest fires in the past, wilderness fires today should be allowed to burn themselves out. Rarely publicized is the fact that once land is declared wilder ness, it no longer has much to offer for recreation. People can&#39;t drive to a fishing area or a campsite because roads are prohibited; nor are any types of motors allowed, even though recent extensive studies by outdoor biologists have proven motors have little or no impact on wildlife. Building a permanent shelter is prohibited, and the Government has gone far enough to destroy many that were built long before the land was declared wilderness. This blanket policy has not only deprived hikers and other trail users of shelter they sometimes need, but has meant the destruction of historic structures built by men who used only an ax and a saw. In some  715     areas campfires aren&#39;t even allowed, and visitors may not have ar ticles made of foil or plastic in possession. Toilets were removed at one time from a trail on Mount Whitney in California because the structures didn&#39;t blend with the land scape. Later they found the trail littered with human waste, so the forest service ordered it closed to everyone except a few hikers who presumably were waste proof.  What bureaucrats and activists alike overlook is that there are really two kinds of wilderness. One is physical, in which land is left untouched and unchanged. The other is spiritual wilderness, where people can go to get away from, though very briefly, the rules and regulations of bureaucratic harassment that are increasingly a part of our lives. Wilderness, as defined by the act of 1964, untrammeled by man, protects the physical but destroys the spiritual wilderness. In es sence, wilderness under the act is the private preserve of a very small minority, people who have the strength and the time to hike into it and who don t mind the rules and regulations imposed upon them. But how much land should we devote to that use? Many people wonder if the millions of acres of unused trees are partly to blame for the inflationary price of housing timber and paper products, not to mention other wood-based items such as pho tographic film, recording tape, rayon, cosmetics, and medicines. When you remove millions of trees off the market, the price of wood-related things is effected. The same goes for other products that could be mined or farmed on the same land. Also many of us back-country users are getting disgusted with all of the restrictions, despite those few who don&#39;t mind all of their back-country travel regulated. It was the wilderness people who gave the environmental lobbies the money and power to push their wilderness bills through Congress. They could just as easily reverse the process if frustration builds up. It seems obvious to me if some groups persist that we keep adding more wilderness, the public, one day, could overreact and eventually scrap all of it. Idaho&#39;s 3.8 million acres of wilderness is enough, taking into con sideration this is nearly one-fifth of the national forest lands in the State. Any additional wilderness will only prohibit our type of orfrom doing our share of trail maintenance in Idaho&#39;s ?;anization brests, which we no donate hundreds of man-hours and maintain hundreds of miles of each year for the benefit of all back-country travelers.","Thank you very much.

My turn. Senator McClure and panel members, my name is Gene Place. I am a farmer and rancher residing in Hamer, Idaho. I testify today as president of the Clark County Stockgrowers Association, a 35-member group organized in 1936 to help insure economic survival while grazing public ranges. Our mem bers own about 30,000 head of cattle and 50,000 head of sheep that provide food and fiber for thousands of Americans. These livestock are grazed across all types of public lands, including Forest Servicecontrolled lands in the Targhee Forest. We feel we presently have a good working relationship with all the Government agencies that regulate our allotments. For the most part, we have learned to be good stewards of the range. Our range improvement programs ben efit all types of wildlife. Our improved livestock watering facilities water deer and elk as well as sheep and cattle. This is done at no cost to the Idaho sportsman.  Specifically, our organization strongly opposes the Palisades and Lionhead areas to be included as wilderness designation. Not only do we fear inhibited travel and management ability for our herds in those areas, we see them as spawning grounds for such preda tors as grizzly bears, grey wolves, and coyotes. As a matter of prin ciple, our group opposes the addition of one more single acre to the 3.8 million acres of wilderness already in Idaho. The West was set tled by a man on a horse with a gun, a trap, a plow, a shovel, an ax, a herd of cattle and a will to succeed. America was not made strong by a hippie with a backpack looking for solitude. And, Senator, as you study this issue, keep this correlated fact in mind: In the lower 48 States Idaho presently ranks top in wilder ness acres and second from the bottom in money spent for educa tion. Could it be that in our State providing grizzly bear dens is more important than providing classrooms for our children? If you continue to lock up our natural resources, remember Sena tor, there&#39;s another big bear with a hammer and sickle that sits in his den and smiles. Thank you, Senator.","Thank you.

Senator McClure, distinguished members of this committee, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Senate Committee on Energy and National Resources to testify on an issue as important as the management of Idaho resources. My name is Gordon Aland with Monsanto Co. located in Soda Springs, Caribou County. Monsanto Co. supports the position of no increase in wilderness. Monsanto is not against wilderness but asks the question, &#39;How much wilderness is enough?&#39; The preservationists want Idaho locked up. A total wilderness is not enjoyed by the public or by their descendants as is so often claimed. A wilderness is only en joyed by a favored few, the wealthy who hire someone to take them in, or fly in, and the college student or college professor who can take 3 months off to hike the length of the wilderness. The key isn&#39;t to lock up, but to manage. The ever-increasing withdrawal of public lands to be locked up and enjoyed by only a favored few is not in the best interest of the State. The lands serve the State best when they provide public access, public recreation, public jobs, and public schools. Idaho, a natural resource State, needs the economy of multiple-use public lands to support the public education system. In these times when public services make higher demands on the State&#39;s economy, it makes more logic to choose a course where the public lands can be managed for the best interests of the State, multiple use. The claim of a wilderness being needed to support a tourist in dustry is hard to understand. If a wilderness area developed a tour ist industry, then tourism should be Idaho&#39;s No. 1 industry. The hard to get to areas have always been here. Even with multiple  721  use, many areas will remain hard to get to and should attract tour ists according to this theory. In the real world it is accessibility, not isolation that develops a tourist industry. Tourism depends on the ability of people to get to  the scenic panorama, the fishing, boating, or picture-taking. Tour ism is participation, not oohs and ahs over a picture postcard. To develop tourism, Idaho should study Switzerland. No one has ever claimed that Switzerland has been raped and ruined, yet the Swiss have made nearly every area accessible. They use roads from Roman eras, trails, trains, and trams to make the beauty accessible to those who can&#39;t climb or hike. And yet those who do desire to take the more athletic approach can still climb or hike and enjoy the same beauty as the less arduous tourist. We support an accessible State managed for the benefit of all, not locked up for a few. Thank you.",Thank you. Robin Jenkins.,GORDON A.

Guess I didn&#39;t get out of bed early enough this morning, it&#39;s a little drive from Salmon, but I&#39;m Rex Tolman; I&#39;m a rancher in Lemhi County. I&#39;m a Lemhi County cattleman and  horse grower at the present. We have a family ranch there. We run about 250 head of beef cows and about 30 head of milk cows. But my speech will be short today, short and sweet. I will read what I&#39;ve got here. Lemhi County is the fourth largest county in the State of Idaho. It consists of about 2,930,000 acres. About 240,000 acres are private ly owned. There is about 460,000 acres currently in the Salmon River Wilderness in the No Return Wilderness. In addition, there&#39;s 30,000 acres of BLM being recommended as a wilderness study, and there&#39;s three small tracts right now in the Lemhi County that is an administrative appeal. One of these wilderness administrative ap peals is one they put on my range while I have some cows up there, and I don t know why anyone would want their wilderness up there when they could go out to Bush Creek Flat and find just about as pretty an area as it is there. But, anyway, our basic indus try in the county is agriculture. There is about 85 percent of agri culture â€” is returned from agriculture from beef cattle. There is wood products and mining. All these industries depend on public lands. How much land can we afford to lock up? We currently have an area about the size of Rhode Island set aside for the wilderness in Lemhi County right now. Just to think of that, the State of Rhode Island; we&#39;ve got that much wilderness in Lemhi County. The State has got the second most wilderness in any of the other lower States in the United States, and we are the second to the lowest paid in schools. So, I think the Government&#39;s got a little bit more locked up in wildereness than we need right now. I&#39;m a strong believer in multiple use, and so is the association. We have done and we have been working together with lumber  723  and mining for the last 125 years, and I think that we can work as multiple use for the next years. Lemhi County Horse Growers Association would like to recom mend that the wilderness issue be resolved and that no further land be taken out of open use management in Lemhi County.

Paul","president, Idaho Alpine Club",,,m,"Mr. Henslee. Yes. Senator McClure, panel memers, my name is Paul Henslee, and as president of Idaho Alpine Club, I represent approximately 150 concerned wilderness users. Our membership  uses the national forest of Idaho on a weekly basis throughout the year for a number of widely varying activities, including hiking, climbing, cross-country skiing, white-water rafting, kayaking, trail clearing, and maintenance, fishing, and hunting. It is my understanding that, included in the charter of the na tional forests, and yourself as an elected official, is the mainte nance of water quality through watershed preservation, fisheries, wildlife, research, and recreation. As a representative of a conservation-oriented organization, I must implore you to take a conservative approach to the proposed wilderness legislation. It is obvious from your statements that you are not prowUderness and, therefore, nonconservative with respect to the dispensation of Idaho&#39;s, as well as the Nation&#39;s, natural re sources. Since the fundamental future character of Idaho is being decided here, not just outdoor opportunities on 6 million acres of Federal land, we must take the conservative approach. The conservative approach to this wilderness issue which the Idaho Alpine Club endorses is the banking of our natural resources for future generations to enjoy and to use as the need appears, not the widespread exploitation of our natural resources for the poten tial gain of a few in the timber or mining industries. All too much attention has been paid to the few who seek to exploit Idaho&#39;s lim ited natural resources for some minor capital gain. The timber in dustry is a perfect example in the State of Idaho where, in the Targhee for example, deficit timber sales have taken place time after time to an industry with more than adequate backlog of re sources. I cited some examples here. And I question, is this indus trial socialism or is there room for those of us who do not make a profit from the Nation&#39;s resources to break even or perhaps gain? Accordingly, the Idaho Alpine Club endorses the 10 Endangered Idaho Wilderness Core Areas whose fish and wildlife habitat are most threatened by ill-advised commercial development: Palisades, Garns Mountain, North Lemhis, Boulder/White Clouds, Sawtooth Completion, Salmo-Priest, Payette Crest, Great Burns/Cayuse  724     Creek, Long Canyon/Selkirk Crest, and Mallard-Larkins. We addi tionally support wilderness designation for the Borah Peak, Lion head, Pioneer, Diamond Peak, Cache Crest, and Italian Peak Road less Areas on specific wildlife and recreational considerations too long to list. The Idaho Alpine Club further opposes hard release for any fur ther planning area not included in current wilderness legislation. Eastern Idaho possesses many such areas along the Overthrust Belt with possible oil and gas deposits, take the Palisades area, for example. No discoveries have been made, and seismic testing is just underway. We feel banning any further planning area from later wilderness considerations merely because it might contain oil and gas would be poor planning and a mockery of past public input on national forest management plans.

Yes, I&#39;m Lorenzo Goodrich. I would like to submit some ideas to you this afternoon, Senator McClure. First of all, I&#39;ve heard a lot of emotion here, but I have not heard any clear man agement objectives from either you or anyone else. I think the first business we have to do is to get into management objectives. Stat ing our ideas, that first one numbered there, is that there can be no compromise in water quality. Second of all, we do need sus tained yields in our logging operations in the State of Idaho. We owe it to our offspring to supply them with good living. Also, in mining, we should have sustained mining. We do not need ups and downs in the mining area. Resources in a given area should be evaluated. I personally believe that in the Palisades area we should find out what&#39;s there. If there&#39;s oil there, let&#39;s use it. If there&#39;s not, let&#39;s des ignate it as wilderness and use it for a very good purpose. I think we need to do more. Some other ideas that I have in written testimony; I think the approach to accomplish these objectives would be to first accept the RARE II as a base. RARE II we have paid for. These ideas are from professionals, and if we don&#39;t accept this, it&#39;s like going to a doctor     733  and getting advice and telling him to go to hell. So, I believe that we should accept them, too. Also, and my conservation friends may not like this, there are some areas that we need to use. The logging and mining industries have to be able to look at their future. The way it is right now, they cannot do that. And we have some areas that we feel very strongly about that we not in RARE II. The Burns Creek area and Kelley Creek we feel that these areas must be maintained as a wil derness area. We have made a lot of mistakes in that area. If you read the fish and game department&#39;s 5-year management plan, they have numerous comments in there about how the water fall in that area has been locked and has been locked and has been overgrazed and has gone down. The Kelley Brook area is magnifi cent. It&#39;s one of the few areas left, not only in Idaho, but in the United States, where the drainage is intact. We must maintain that drainage. Second of all, in the Idaho Falls area, the Garns Mountain area and, mainly, Burns area, must be â€” the water quality must be maintained. The Idaho Fish and Game Department has told us that approximately 45 percent of all the spawning in the South Fork of the Snake River occurs in Burns Creek. If we lose Burns Creek, we have lost not only the spawning, but also the fishermen in South Fork. Now, there is a great economic value to businesses in this area on South Fork of the Snake River. Our associations in the federa tion is doing work with the Idaho Fish and Game Department to bring back Palisades Creek, which was lost due to poor practices in the past. We also helped them along on Burns Creek. We&#39;d like the idea of multiple use. But a gentleman that testified earlier, I think, echoed our summons. He was a rancher and he said, we have worked well with lumber and mining. What happened to us, the sportsmen? They have not worked well at all with the sportsmen. We are very annoyed at them because we feel that we can show them how we can have our cake and eat it too. We don&#39;t feel that we have to tie up enormous lands, but we feel we have to direct oversediment, which is occurring more and more, especially in this area, than I&#39;ve seen in the 20 years that I have been in Idaho. So, Senator we feel that we should adopt the RARE II and that we should protect Kelley Creek and Barns Mountain. We also would like to see a more comprehensive multiple-use plan.",,LORENZO GOODRICH,"FEDERATION OF FLY, FISHERS",Goodrich,Lorenzo,h1d2,"goodrich, lorenzo",Idaho (STATE); Palisades (LANDFORM); Burns Creek (STREAM); Kelly Creek (STREAM); Kelley Brook (STREAM); United States (COUNTRY); Idaho Falls (CITY); Garns Mountain (LANDFORM); South Fork (STREAM); Snake River (STREAM); Palisades Creek (STREAM); Barns Mountain (LANDFORM),text

Thank you, Senator McClure. Before I go into the statement I have here, I would like to take a second to make a statement about common phrase, hippie backpacker. I&#39;ve heard this a lot, and I think we really should go on the record. I think it&#39;s an insult to the millions of families, the backpackers, the hunters, the fishermen, the scientists, all users of wilderness, and I take ex ception to this. I don&#39;t insult other people&#39;s recreational hobbies, and I think this is a really low blow. I&#39;d like to take just a second, also, to respond, because we talk about going into the wilderness with a shotgun and a shovel, and that&#39;s a lot different from what we have now, millions of fourwheel-drive vehicles and chain saws, a far cry from going into an area on foot or on horseback. And these areas need some protection from the technology that Americans have. And I think we need to keep that in mind, too. I strongly urge the protection of White Cloud-Boulder Mountain and the Lemhis. White Cloud for its spectacular view, because it&#39;s on standing recommendation to provide resources and crucial habi tat for elk, deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, and also provides salmon spawning grounds. I believe we should continue the prohi bition of mining. Should studies reveal natural resources of miner als, at that time action can be taken. I believe we shall soon develop the option of due process of min erals in wilderness areas, to discover district areas having less mining value and more wilderness value. For example, cyanide is being used to properly extract oil levels of 10 particles or less. We would have wilderness areas we can study to find our Nation&#39;s minerals. I would like to see wilderness designation for the Lemhis, espe cially the lower Lemhis. I feel there should be wilderness consider ation for Black Canyon. Wilderness areas are important, and once they are gone they cannot be brought back. I would like to see Black Canyon, Selkirk Crest, the Lemhis, Diamond Peak, the Lost River Range, Borah Peak, White Cloud/Boulder Mountain, all of these become wilder ness areas, also, Pahsimeroi. I suggest that it is not unreasonable to consider soft release lan guage in the wilderness bill. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today, Senator.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator. I represent the Bonneville County Sportsmen&#39;s Association. We had a lot of views here on how people feel about the wilderness, and primarily I&#39;ve read through a lot of studies and I agree with the Fish and Game thought, that we should protect as much area of the State as possible, including 50 percent of the remaining 6.5 million acres, very soft language in the wilderness bill so we can protect these areas and, at a future time, if we do find out that there was a good economic reason to exploit them, later we could. The problem with getting into these areas once you do is they are so easily damaged because they&#39;re so high you&#39;ll never get any of the timber to grow back, like up in the Palisades district, if you log off the Ponderosa, and once they figure the Ponderosa goes, there won&#39;t be anything left there to grow, so we&#39;ll lose that habi tat, too. Then, primarily, you can notice this on the logs on the clear water. When the log saws come in here in the winter â€” or in the spring, when the waters are running and then you look at the clear water comes in muddy from all the logging, which silts up all the springs and prevents spawning, that&#39;s part of the reason we have had such bad salmon runs. Thank you. OK, Thank you. So that&#39;s primarily what the problem we&#39;re dealing with is. But it would be great to save all of the areas, but the way that we can save these for the best part of Idaho is if we go through them line by line, area by area, and work it out with all the interested groups so that we don&#39;t lose any good areas that would be very good for elk habitat, but would also be good for something other, you know, so we don&#39;t log off a really good section of old growth where the big mountain caribou are in Idaho. We wouldn&#39;t lose the area to logging and lose that whole species where there are a lot of other places, say down and around that have been logged off before, down and around Coeur d'Alene, that would be suitable for logging again. But it&#39;s just kind of a â€” it should be a balanced approach with everybody having their 2 cents worth to speak so that we can get the greatest amount of benefit out of the forest for the sportsmen and for the long-range terms of Idaho. Because if we go in there and tear them up over the short term, we&#39;re going to make money, and there&#39;s going to be logging, and we&#39;re going to sell equipment, but in the long term, it&#39;s going to be just another ghost town like Gilmore, and that&#39;s not what Idaho needs. We have enough primary industries. What we need is nice manufacturing that produces dollars in and dollars out. We have them year after year versus logging and mining, which some of these areas they&#39;re talking about logging are so cold, it will take 40 years for the trees to grow back. That&#39;s logging; with the mining, once the minerals are gone, we&#39;ll be stuck with the same problems like we have in northern Idaho currently. Thank you.","Thank you.

Senator McClure, Senator Symms, members of the  committee, my name is Spencer Strand. I represent the Central Idaho Rod and Gun Club, which is headquartered in Challis, Idaho, and I am a past president of this organization which has been in existence and active for over 35 years. The following testimony was given at the wilderness hearing in Salmon, Idaho, in May of 1979. In August of 1983 we reaffirm those convictions and I will thus make the following statement. The proposed wilderness concept if enacted is thought to mean preservation of our lands in their natural state, untouched by modern technology. It is thought to be a place where all people can visit to experience nature to its fullest. It is a concept that seems to be favored by large numbers of the Nation&#39;s population. What is sad is that the people, by large, that favor expansion of the wilder ness areas to this exaggerated extent, have been misinformed and do not really understand the true consequences of such a measure. At present, we have our Federal lands governed by the U.S. Forest Service, the BLM, and other governmental agencies and managed under the multiple use concept. By multiple use we mean recreation, conservation, hunting, fishing, logging, mining, grazing, and industry. The term, multiple use, in our opinion, means maxi mizing the use of the lands is as many ways as possible, to benefit as many people as possible, without destroying its natural gran deur. The governmental agencies established to manage these lands have done a very thorough job in accomplishing this goal. The wilderness concept that seems to be the popular choice of many Americans should also be considered. As mentioned before, wilderness under the multiple use concept means using the wilder ness for as many uses as possible without destroying its natural beauty. Under the wilderness concept these lands will have only one use, that being recreation under the disguise of preservation. What is really sad about this concept is that it will benefit only a few people. Those people who favor wilderness because of preserva  768    tion and recreation for all Americans have been misinformed. What wilderness will mean for the vast majority will be exclusion. Those being excluded will be the very young, the very old, the physically handicapped, and anyone in general not having the time or money to visit these areas. It will be a great place for a small minority of greed Americans who have effectively conned the ma jority of their fellow countrymen into creating a private play ground for themselves. After reviewing the concept of wilderness versus nonwilderness, we the members of the Central Idaho Hod and Gun Club go on record unanimously as opposing any increase in wilderness areas. Our club has always been in favor of conservation. We also recog nize the rights of man to make a living. In addition, we believe in the responsibility of industry and government to supply the needs of all Americans whether it be jobs or the supplying of goods and services so necessary to our survival. The only way that all of the needs of all Americans can be fulfilled equally is by keeping our lands under the multiple use management concept.","Thank you, Keith Clark.",SPENCER STRAND,"PAST PRESIDENT, CENTRAL, IDAHO ROD AND GUN CLUB",Strand,Spencer,h1d2,"strand, spencer",Challis (CITY); Salmon (STREAM),text

I rep  resent Jefferson County Cattlemen Association, which has a mem bership of 150 cattlemen and their wives. We support your proposal No. 1, which is no additional wilder ness acres.  Our main concern is grazing for the cattle industry in Idaho. Grass is the life blood of the cattleman. To make more wilderness in Idaho is like strangling the cattlemen of this State. We feel it is wasteful in this great land of ours to not utilize some of our special resources, namely, grass and water. The Forest Service records show that there is only minimal use of wilderness already designated for recreation. We say, why waste additional acres for the recreation of those very few who do not particularly enrich our State through tourism? Our forest should be accessible to everyone, both rich, poor, and handicapped. We feel the wilderness area, as now designated, cannot be uti lized by the handicapped people of our State. We feel that the economy of Idaho needs the logging industry be cause it holds the equalizing key to employment and brings in 25 percent of the State&#39;s nonfarm income. Also 25 percent of the value of national forest timber sold goes back to the counties where the timber is harvested. Seventy percent of this money is used for county roads and 30 percent for the support of the schools. There is no way, Senator, that you can offset the happiness of a minimum few backpackers with improvement of our roads or with the educa tion of our most priceless possession, our children. Last year the forest income for our State was $6,674,923. This was from grazing, timber, and mining. The BLM ground revenue from the same resources was $5,346,000. This was $12 million from the multiple use of our forests. This money is earmarked for roads  769  and schools inside the State. We urge you to limit the wilderness area to what we already have. Idaho needs this revenue. The stewardship of our State land and national forests is indeed yours and our concern.

I am a forester living in St. Maries, Idaho. I am representing and am employed by Edwards Investments, buying  timber for two sawmills. Our log and pulp needs are 60 million  board feet of saw timber per year and 30 million board feet of pulp  in a normal economic year. The past 4 years have not qualified as  such.  Further delay in releasing roadless areas to production or additional commitments to our existing designated wilderness will be  detrimental to the economy of north Idaho as well as many companies. Where are the figures and studies that verify that we need  more wilderness? Who will fund and pay for these studies? Ironically the industries that many are attempting to place out of business by increasing this nonproductive land designation are paying.  Many of the very people and groups that advocate more wilderness  are the very people that say we need to change our lifestyleâ€”that  is, we must conserve more and waste less. By avocating wilderness  they are advocating waste on a large scale that is astronomical. To  not utilize a renewable resource when it is mature is wrong. To  lose the growth capability of good timber sites due to overmature  timber stands is wrong. To have entire drainages burn from wild   fire due to lack of vegetation management is wrong for water quality as well as wildlife. Have we become this affluent that we can  afford this waste?",,JOHN BRUNS,EDWARDS INVESTMENTS,Bruns,John,h2d1,"bruns, john",St. Maries (CITY),text

My husband is a  unit manager of a local sawmill and therefore, our livelihood is derived from the timber industry.  I am in favor of &#39;No More Wilderness in Idaho.&#39; As a member of  Idaho Women in Timber, however, we have decided to support the  Idaho Forest Industry Council&#39;s position.  My husband and I are native Idahoans, and depend on the  timber industry in one way or another all of our lives. We believe  in a well-managed forest for multiple use. We love to get back to  nature to hunt, fish, pick berries, and to camp as much as anyone  else. We know we can do all these things and still have timber  available to harvest if the forest if properly managed.  A tree is a crop. As such, whenever its full growth is reached it  will die, that tree will be very vulnerable to disease, bug infestation  and rot. Whenever enough trees in a forest die, become diseased,  infested and rotted, they will fall and cause a terrible fire hazard. I  know this is supposed to be nature&#39;s way, but man was given a  brain, I believe, to come up with better ways of coping with some of  these stuations. It is my belief that these trees should be harvested  at proper intervals and the forest replanted either by human hands  or by leaving seed trees to help Mother Nature.     Just because an area is put into multiple use does not necessarily  mean the trees will be harvested. Many areas are not suitable for  harvest but the more wilderness there is in Idaho, the less accessible the timber is to get to and the less allowable cut, therefore the  less jobs available in the timber industry. With unemployment the  way it is today, we need all the jobs we can get. We don t need additional mill closures due to the lack of allowable timber sales.  I believe the most important thing is to settle this roadless issue  once and for all. It has been sufficiently studied by the Forest Service in the past and we now need to get a firm bill written with  hard release language in it.","Thank you very much.

I appreciate the opportunity  to express my thoughts on a subject that is important to me. My  husband is a forester and is employed by the forest industry in  Idaho. I, too, am a forester, holding a bachelor of science degree in  forest recreation. As you can see, my interests, as well as livelihood, are dependent on a healthy forest resource. I am here today  in behalf of Idaho Women in Timber as well as to express some  thoughts from my own experiences.  As the previous two speakers have said, Idaho Women in Timber  would like a quick resolution of the roadless areas, and we urge  that the 5 years of RARE II study and the resulting environmental  impact statement be recognized as sufficient, and that the roadless  29  areas not designated as wilderness be released to the Forest Service  for management.  On the personal side, I would like to put my recreation education  and experience to work and address two misconceptions held by  the general public concerning wilderness. The first is that congressionally designated wilderness is needed for a wilderness experience. I believe that wilderness is an imprecise term in the public&#39;s  mind, defined by personal perceptions. In the summer of 1974, I  worked for the National Park Service in Washington, D.C., presenting nature programs to inner-city children attending day camps.  Often this would include a nature hike through the woods. To my  surprise, many of the children were hesitant to enter the woods for  fear that lions, tigers or bears would get them. To these children  Rock Creek Park, in the center Washington D.C., was the wilderness and as much of it as they wanted to handle. Of course this  example is extreme, but points out the fact that different people  with differing perspectives can get optimum wilderness experiences  from areas other than congressionally designated wilderness. This  includes parks, unroaded back country and forests managed for  other benefits including wood production. In fact some of the restrictions of wilderness actually deter use or dampen the recreational enjoyment of many people. There are, of course, those for  whom only the true wilderness will do and their needs should be  recognized. They, in fact have been recognized with 3.8 million     acres in Idaho.

Senator McClure, and members of the delegation,  my name is Jackie McAvoy. I live in Post Falls and I&#39;m a member  of Idaho Women in Timber. My husband and I both work in the  timber industry and much of our free time is usually spent camping and fishing. Because of my job, I could probably intelligently  quote facts and figures relating to the impact that failure to settle  the roadless area issue could have on the 20,000 Idahoans like me     directly employed in the timber industry. But I&#39;m sure these figures will be cited many times before these hearing are over, therefore, I&#39;m going to focus on one area that affects me personally.  My family has gone through the whole spectrum of camping experiences from sleeping bags thrown on the opened ground to a  tent, and now to a 23-foot camp trailer.  Since most of our leisure time is limited to weekend and holiday  camping, we find most of our activities centered in north Idaho.  As an avid fly fisherman, my husband's favorite areas are the  rivers, streams, and lakes in the Bonners Ferry area. One of the  controversial areas proposed for wilderness designation is the Long  Canyon area. I would like to see this area designated for multiple  use with limited roads for recreational use and timber removal.  With this designation, folks like us could explore the area.  I&#39;d like to tell you about an experience that has influenced my  feelings about wilderness. A few years ago we were camped near  the Bob Marshall Wilderness area in Montana and decided we  should take the time to hike into it. I was appalled at what I saw.  In some areas the trail was trampled 12 to 10 feet deep. It has  rained recently, and water was diverted down the trail like it was a  streambed. Off the path deadfalls and diseased trees that has toppled over made exploring dangerous. I couldn&#39;t help thinking that  it would be interesting to know how many homes could have been  built with the dead trees if they had been harvested. It took just a  few hours to know this wasn&#39;t my type of forest. Just give me the  wilderness experience without the wilderness.  Thank you.",,JACQUELLIN L.

Thank you, Senator. My name is Barbara Rawlings. I&#39;m a downtown business owner, homeowner, and resident of  Bonners Ferry, and I&#39;m speaking today on behalf of the Boundary  Backpackers.  32  Boundary Backpackers is an organization that began over 4  years ago as a group of volunteers who were dedicated to maintaining and restoring trails through Long Canyon. You will hear more  about our trail work in a later testimony.  We have never considered ourselves a political group, but due to  the controversial nature of this wilderness issue, we find it necessary to take a political stand at this time. And our desire is to see  that Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest are officially recognized  for what they already are, which is a majestic wilderness.  On behalf of the members of Boundary Backpackers, I&#39;d like to  make the following points: We support the I.C.L., Endangered  Idaho Wilderness Corps, which includes Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest. We also recommend that the Salmo Priest be included  in the Washington Wilderness bill. We recommend that all other  forest lands in boundary County included in RARE II be designated  multiple use.  We as a group want to make it clear that recommendations of  the Bonners Ferry City Council, the school board, and the Boundary County Commissioners come from what is a very small group of  special vested interest people. None of these groups is actually  thought of as representing the community at large due to the fact  that no public input was requested before these resolutions were  voted on.  Finally, as you listen to testimony today we ask that you please     be aware that economics is only one part of a number of points  that need to be considered in this issue.  Boundary Backpackers is dedicated to this issue because of our  deep respect for Long Canyon. We began simply as volunteers  taking care of a trail to an old growth forest in our area, and when  the preservation of Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest is assured,  we will return to just that task.

In order to lessen the  impact by man in these areas of the wilderness, we need to provide  more, not less.  I have visited five wilderness areas in Idaho, and I have used  these areas by the pack trip, as myself, the day hikers, backpackers, men, women, the very young in their parents&#39; arms, and the  very old. Do we need to place a dollar sign on each person that  visits the wilderness? I think not.

Aug-16-1983,aug-16-1983-fritz-jane,conservationist,,"Fritz, Jane",Idaho Conservation League,,,f,"Ms. Fritz. Senator McClure and friends: My name is Jane Fritz.  Today, I am testifying on behalf of the Idaho Conservation League  in regards to the hard release language that has been outlined in  the Idaho Forest Industries Council wilderness proposal.  As conservationists, we feel this hard release language is shorsighted and contrary to sound planning. It would essentially eliminate wilderness as a legitimate multiple use from future Forest  Service management activities. Hard release is inconsistent with  the congressional mandates that have been thoughtfully adopted to  guide the Forest Service in their management of our national forests. The Multiple Use and Yield Act, the Wilderness Act and the  National Forest Management Act all recognize the consistency of  wilderness with multiple use management. We feel these laws are  sufficient in providing ibr the periodic review of roadless areas and  35  for allowing management decisions to be made by the Forest Serviceâ€”the agency who has the expertise to do so. Wilderness does not  conflict with the multiple use principal because it provides wildlife  and fish habitat, affords watershed protection, offers recreational  opportunities and supplies forage for livestock. Only one multiple  useâ€”timber harvestingâ€”is incompatible with wilderness.  The Idaho Conservation League supports the National Environmental Policy Act sufficiency language which precludes any legal  challenge to the RARE II process in Idaho. And we request that  soft release language be included in your bill, Senator. By soft release we mean allowing roadless lands not classified as wilderness  in your legislation to be handled through the regular multiple use  planning process. The Forest Service would retain the option to  manage lands for timber or any other resource, including wilderness, in future forest plans. We believe this would be the least complicated, most cost-effective and only equitable approach for all  parties concerned. Land in nonprotected status would be reviewed  with every updated 10-year forest plan with careful consideration  to all management options. Soft release language would also insure  adequate lands for the recreational needs of future generations.",,JANE FRITZ,IDAHO CONSERVATION LEAGUE,Fritz,Jane,h2d1,"fritz, jane",,text

I am Joe Hinson, executive director, Idaho Forest  Industry Council for the association that represents the timber industry in the State.  This is an issue in which the fact can be somewhat misleading,  as I&#39;m sure you know, Senator. Nuances of multiple use, sustained  yield, timber under contract, allowable harvests are all somewhat  mind-boggling. I think we oftentimes confuse the public when we  use those terms. So, I&#39;d like to cut through some of that and talk  just in a very general sense about what this is all about.  We provide about 20,000 people in good years in the State of  Idaho. We provide about 25 percent of the total amount of our economic base, and we&#39;re a significant factor in maintaining secondary  industries: Retail and wholesale trade, services, real estate, finance,  and in-State tourism. In short, we feel we are very vital to the  State&#39;s economy.  We are almost totally dependent upon timber from the National  forests. The national forests probably own 75 percent of all the  commercial mature timber in the State, and unless that agency  sells its fair share, our industry is virtually doomed. There is no  real alternative source. Private lands amount to about 15 percent  of the total commercial land ownership in this State.  41  The Forest Service sales program has been reduced over the past  decade.

Plum Creek Timber Co. specifically requests that any wilderness  bill contain provisions for legislated land exchanges whereby the  private landowner could convey to the Government his lands which  were impacted by wilderness designation, and in exchange acquire  equally valued properties from the Government. Insofar as Plum  Creek Timber Co. is concerned, there are two such areas where legislated exchanges will likely be desirable. They are the Scotchman  Peak, approximately 2,000 acres, and Mallard-Larkins, approximately 6,500 acres.  Plum Creek Timber Co. management has for many years recog   nized the high recreation values that exist on the company lands  within these areas. We have deferred construction of roads and  harvesting of timber pending resolution of the public debate over  eventual land use allocation of the adjacent Federal lands. However, we cannot continue to defer our managment activities indefinitely. Should the public debate and subsequent legislation regarding these areas fail to pass in the near future, we will need to construct roads and harvest the timber.

I&#39;m Mike Welling, resource manager for Idaho  Forest Industries, and we strongly support the IFIC stand for wilderness.  You have heard many arguments from preservationists during  the past week for making roadless areas wilderness. One of these is  that the American people should not subsidize the timber industry  by building roads into those roadless areas because of a very low  benefit for others. I&#39;d like to give you two examples that would  counter this. One example where timber dollars have enhanced  recreation values is along the main Coeur d'Alene River. The  entire road above Enaville, over 20 miles, was built with timber  purchaser dollars. Appropriated money has since asphalted this     road, but the original investment came from timber sale dollars  which opened this beautiful river to literally tens of thousands of  people each year to fish and camp. It is one of the highest used  recreation areas in Idaho. The millions of board feet of timber that  comes down this road each year has not lessened the beauty of this  area.  Besides the Coeur d'Alene River the other major entrance to the  Coeur d'Alene National Forest is over the Fernan Hill Road. This  is the major access from the highly populated Spokane area.  In 1939 when this road was built, it was paid for with appropriated money. There was not enough timber adjacent to this road to  support the original investment. In fact, it was nearly 5 years later  that the first timber sale was put up.  Since that time there has been over 1 billion board feet of timber  hauled on this subsidized road. It would be hard to calculate the  amount of times that the net receipts to the Government have  been increased because they subsidized the original investment. In  fact, since that time, timber purchasers&#39; money has double-laned  and improved this road.  50  Recreation and timber, along with wildlife and water can exist  side by side. No one is subsidized when everyone benefits from an  investment to the future.

There is concern by some people for the small group of caribou  which apparently spend most of their time in British Columbia, but  have in the past wandered into north Idaho and northeastern  Washington. Some people feel the Salmo Priest should be included  in the wilderness system in order to preserve the caribou. We feel  that caribou do not require wilderness to survive.  The greatest cause of unnatural mortality to the caribou appears  to be illegal hunting. Mandatory road closures of all new access  roads into caribou habitat and public education would alleviate the  threat of illegal hunting. Also, approximately 80 percent of the proposed Salmo Priest wilderness area is not prime caribou habitat. At  this time the Forest Service has identified approximately 210,000     acres on the Colville and Panhandle National Forests where caribou should be considered in management plans for the area.

Mr. Dickison. Senator, I am Jim Dickison, and I am a resource  manager for Louisiana-Pacific. I am addressing the Idaho Forest  Industry Council&#39;s position on Long Canyon and the Selkirk Crest  area. This is more detailed in the book just submitted.  Long Canyon contains valuable timber resources, which are  needed to help support the local economy. Long Canyon poses management challenges which, if met, can assure the needs of sportsmen, back country recreationists, the timber industry, and the  local economy be achieved.  Long Canyon and Parker Canyon, which is the adjacent drainage  to the south, have similar characteristics except that Parker  Canyon is not economically feasible to access. From a timber industry standpoint, there are three objectives which should be achieved  in a comprehensive management plan for the Selkirk area: Retaining the biological productivity of Long Canyon and Parker Canyon  as a component of the annual allowable harvest; allowing harvest  of mature timber within Long Canyon; and maintaining desirable  back country recreation values in Long Canyon, Parker Canyon,  and the Selkirk Crest.  Industry believes these objectives can be met through implement   ing management plans which include roadless, back country status  for the Selkirk Crest and Parker Canyon; low impact logging methods and/or snow roads for any areas to be harvested in Long  Canyon; strict, effective road closures for any roads entering Long  Canyon; design of cutting units to minimize visual impact and provide maximum wildlife benefits; preservation of representative  stands of old-growth timber along the trail and adjoining the  stream in Long Canyon; Parker Canyon would be preserved as  roadless in perpetuity; a citizens advisory group which could help  manage this Selkirk area.

During the past three winters, W-I has engaged in Forest Service timber sales in drainages of the Selkirk Mountains, very similar to Long Canyon. These timber sales had been set up to salvage  the spruce bark beetle infested timber and to slow its advance into  other areas. We were confronted with many obstacles and difficult  situations in trying to remove this timber in these fragile areas.  We had to work in very deep snow a short 3-month time period, as  well as the restrictions of working in caribou and grizzly bear habitats.  32-427 0 - 84 5  58  However, by using advanced methods and modern equipment in  building snow roads and trails, and working with the Forest Service, the department of fish and game, and other concerned wildlife  people, we successfully and economically harvested these sales.  W-I feel that if given the opportunity the same successful operations could occur in Long Canyon. The spruce bark beetle has advanced to some near eqidemic proportions in the spruce-Alpine fir  zone of the drainage. There are at least a half dozen pockets of  beetle infected trees ranging from 1 to 2 acres in size. If not harvested and the advance of the insect slowed, the beetle could, in a  very short period of several years leave nothing but a myriad of  spruce snags in this upper zone of the canyon.  By means of a low-impact road entering from the north side of  the drainage, the Smith Creek side as the sole access, Long Canyon  could be opened to harvest the timber resource. By winter logging  through the use of snow roads and trails, leaving the soil and undergrowth virtually undisturbed, very few scars are left on the  land. The dying, diseased, and overmature trees can be harvested  in a manner so as not to open up the timber stands more than is  necessary for proper forest management.

My name is Kevin  Greenleaf, and I&#39;m representing Louisiana-Pacific here this morning from Moyie Springs.  Seemingly, however, over hundreds of years in this country re   source management through confrontation has been the means by  which each particular interest has obtained some part of our natural resources for their own use. Ignoring other&#39;s rights to a voice in  that management has led to a system today through which objective decisions from unbiased parties are sought. The system of relying, in our case, on Congress for decisions as to the disposition of  our local public natural resources, at best, places our congressional  leaders in an adversary position with whoever loses the greater  amount of the resource by their decision.  In respect to the resource, the worst-case decision is one leading  to the degredation of the resource or its potential to rejuvenate  whether it be due to natural causes or to man&#39;s intervention.  The disadvantageous position of being 2,000 miles removed from  the community and its economic, spiritual and recreational needs  only increases the possibility of unwittingly relying on unsubstantiated information or biased fact which increases the chance of  reaching a damaging decision with regard to the resource of a community&#39;s stability.  In the case of Boundary County, as with many rural areas which  depend upon their natural resource both private and public for a  means of tax support and employment, any decision concerning  those resources is deliberated by a greater number of people per  capita than in larger or more industrially diverse communities. A  decision adversely affecting a single industry can have disastrous  effects on not only the people directly employed, but also on the  supporting businesses as well.",,KEVIN GREENLEAF,LOUISIANA-PACIFIC CORP.,Greenleaf,Kevin,h2d1,"greenleaf, kevin",Moyie Springs (CITY); Boundary County (COUNTY),text

Long Canyon contributes a conservative 3 million  board feet annually to the allowable cut on the Bonners Ferry district. Without Long Canyon, the allowable cut will drop from 35  million feet per year to 32 million feet per year; an 8V2-percent reduction. The sale program on the Bonners district 10 years ago was  54 million board feet. As the timber base has been restricted, the  allowable cut has declined.  A 3-million foot reduction in the allowable cut will mean roughly  a loss of 23 direct jobs for Boundary County and a resulting loss of  over $400,000 annually in wages, and also a corresponding loss of  approximately $150,000 each year in stumpage revenues for Government.  Boundary County as a result will receive less money; roads and  schools will have to get by with less money or the local people will  have to pay the additional taxes to keep at current levels.  Long Canyon is an integral part of the timber base for the forest  industry, and managed under miltiple-use objectives will continue  to yield timber crips and other forest values for generations to     come.  We also support the existing management plans for the Selkirk  Crest. We desire to keep it as primitive recreation instead of wilderness.  Louisiana-Pacific has terminated the random length sawmill at  Moyie Springs and continues to operate the studmill. The studmill  by itself could utilize more wood than is sold on the Bonners Ferry  district. We would still consume the same amount of wood as in  past years by just adding one shift to the studmill. We shouldn&#39;t  lock up these resources from future generations, especially considering what has already been set aside in Idaho. The need for  timber off Forest Service lands will be more critical in the future  with the over cutting occurring on much of the private lands.

Senator McClure, I am Ralph Kizer. I&#39;m a graduate of  the University of Idaho, College of Forestry, and I have recently retired from the U.S. Forest Service after more than 30 years of employment, most of it in north Idaho. I have been forest supervisor  of the Kaniksu and Idaho Panhandle National Forests for the past  12 years.  But I am here today representing over 500 members of the  Inland Empire Society of American Foresters. I am currently chairman of this organization of professional foresters.  The Society supports a complete wilderness preservation system  in the United States, which includes a broad representation of  major ecosystems. The society also supports the nondevelopment of  many areas for primitive recreation, for quality hunting and fishing, for research, and for other non-commodity or amenity purposes.  However, as professional foresters, we question the wisdom of  preserving thousands of acres of commercial forest lands in addition to those already preserved.  Of the 11,800 acres of the Salmo Priest RARE II area, which is in     Idaho, 7,500 acres are suitable for growing timber. We recommend  that the boundary be withdrawn and adjusted to exclude as much  of that as possible.  The Selkirk Crest area contains very little commercially important forest land, and it is now being managed for its wild land  values under a joint agreement between the State of Idaho and the  Forest Service. To us, this seems to be working well, and we don&#39;t  think it is necessary to put it into wilderness, but the tradeoff  would not be great.  The Scotchman Peak proposal is much the same as the Selkirk  Crest. However, there&#39;s 4,200 acres of commercially important forested land in Idaho within this area. Probably most of these areas  could be excluded without detracting from wilderness values.  We propose the original Mallard Larkins Pioneer Area be expanded to include the Five Lakes Butte area, but also that the  boundaries be adjusted to exclude a considerable portion of the  commercial forest lands within the area.

Mr. Chairman, I am Steve Walker representing  Riley Creek Lumber Co. of LaClede.  During the course of these hearings you have heard from forest  industry executives who have urged you to lift the amount of productive forest land set aside as wilderness in your Idaho forest  management bill. They have argued that limited wilderness designations are necessary to maintain Forest Service timber sales programs, and, thus, a healthy woods products industry.  We do not disagree. However, we think there is an even more  compelling reason why additional wilderness designations be kept  to a minimum.  The national forests are a living, dying, dynamic resource which  is best managed by the full professionals of the Forest Service. A  drainage by disease can be logged today and provide semi-primitive  recreational opportunities within a decade. An area that is clearcut  in 1983 can in 10 to 20 years be managed to support a large herd of  elk. People who view the national forests as static and unchanging  are out of touch with ecological realities.  We believe your forest management bill should establish a statutory framework which will provide Forest Service managers with     the flexibility to meet changing public demands for forest products  and services.  To accomplish that objective, the wilderness designations on the  Panhandle Forest should be limited to areas where wilderness will  always be the best use of the land. Other areas where timber can  be harvested and the land then managed for other multiple uses  should not be set aside as wilderness. Long Canyon is a good example of an area that should not become wilderness.  Mr. Chairman, we hope your bill will also end the roadless area  battle in northern Idaho, limit the wilderness designations to the  area and boundaries in the proposal made by the Idaho Forest Industry Council, overturn the California v. Block decision as shown  in my statement, and end any need for additional wilderness  studies.",,STEVE WALKER,RILEY CREEK LUMBER CO.,Walker,Steve,h2d1,"walker, steve",LaClede (CITY); Panhandle Forest (FOREST); Long Canyon (LANDFORM); California (STATE),text

Senator McClure, my name is Gene Ealy. I live in  Kingston, Idaho, and am vice president of exploration for Hecla  Mining Co., and I will speak on its behalf.  Something is happening to our country today, which I&#39;m not accustomed to. It frightens me and should be of greatest concern to  every citizen of the United States, and of this State, of course. Our  standard of living is lowering. We are increasingly dependent on  foreign nations for the raw materials of industry and for our national defense. Our men and women are out of work in a land  which has always been blessed with bountiful natural resources to  feed its economy.  Because mineral deposits are rare and usually buried, they are  difficult and costly to find. Designation of additional wilderness  would narrow the chances of finding these raw materials which are  so badly needed for our industry, and will eventually increase our  dependency on foreign countries to supply such minerals, contribute to a lower standard of living for our people, and exacerbate the  unemployment problem. We, therefore, oppose any addition of national forest lands to wilderness designation.  As an explorationist, I reject the concept that large acreages  such as are proposed to be added to the wilderness can be effectively studied, inventoried, and classified unlikely to contain valuable  minerals. Because significant mineral deposits are relatively small,  usually buried, have highly variable genetic sources and include  such a large number of materials that could be of interest, it is  very difficult to condemn any substantial acreage from containing  128  valuable minerals. In light of futility of the effort, we support release of all RARE II and/or wilderness study lands to multiple use  status.

However, I  am Bill Booth. I do represent Sunshine Mining Co. in Kellogg.  Sunshine operates the largest single silver mine in the United  States at Kellogg, and we are one of Idaho&#39;s primary employers.  We also maintain a vigorous exploration effort with geologists  searching for new mineral deposits throughout the West, but particularly, Senator, here in Idaho.  We support the Idaho Mining Association&#39;s position that Idaho  presently has a reasonable and proper amount of wilderness parcels set aside. Any additional wilderness allocations would be extremely detrimental to the State&#39;s economic base. A reasonable  amount of wilderness is important to our way of life in Idaho, but  don&#39;t forget that our well-being is also critically dependent upon a  sound economic base.  The foundation of Idaho&#39;s economy are the agriculture, timber,  and mining industries. Additional wilderness would cut at the  heart of all three because it would deny access to the primary resources of the Earth.  For example, I asked our geologists to quickly review the new  wilderness acres in this State for potential mineral significance.     They found the following major companies working in or near the  proposed wilderness areas: Anaconda, Noranda, Phillips, Superior,  AMACO, KOMECO, St. Joe Minerals, U.S. Borax, and Simplot.  Any one of these would potentially provide as many, if not more,  jobs in Idaho as Sunshine now does.  Our geologists further noted that some nine separate mineral  districts in the proposed wilderness areas have been given very  thorough analysis by Sunshine and appear to be extremely important economically.  In closing, I&#39;d just like to say that a reasonable amount of wilderness is necessary. We feel that the existing amount is reasonable.","Thank you.

Wilderness study areas have imposed sometimes unreasonble and  impractical limitations on the ability of private enterprise to explore for and develop minerals on public lands. At a time when our  Nation is dependent on politically unstable sources for strategic  minerals, it would seem sensible to open more public lands for exploration and development. Abundant reserves of minerals are  available in lands proposed for wilderness, in addition to wilderness areas themselves.  We already have set aside an adequate percentage of our land     base to remain untouched for future generations. It would now  seem wise to ascertain a mineral inventory for use by future generations.

I work for Anaconda Minerals Co., an  operating company of Atlantic Richfield Co. Atlantic Richfield is  primarily a domestic producer of oil, gas, and minerals. Therefore,  we are very concerned with the management of our Nation&#39;s public  lands. We believe it is essential for the delegation to decide on a  wilderness proposal which will provide a balance of multiple uses.  Anaconda believes that areas should be explored for their energy  and mineral potential prior to permanent placement in a highly restrictive single-use management prescription, such as wilderness.  When a wilderness system was first contemplated, proponents  emphasized that only a limited amount of land was to be included  and therefore, the impact on mineral resources minimized. The  first 14.3 million acres that were designated as wilderness in 1964  were considered an almost miniscule fraction of the Nation&#39;s land.  While Congress has effectively prevented lawful mineral activity  from proceeding in wilderness areas, in addition, through various  appropriations bills, it has effectively extended the closure of lands     from any use to another 40 million acres of land generally under  wilderness consideration, thus preempting the land-use decisionmaking process.  Land placed in wilderness remains so in perpetuity until Congress determines otherwise. It seems only reasonable that land unsuitable for wilderness be returned to multiple-use management in  perpetuity until Congress determines otherwise. We are not opposed to the concept of wilderness designation; however, we are opposed to lands being tied up in de facto wilderness. When Congress  makes its decisions as to which areas should be designated wilderness, there is a concurrent responsibility to release areas deemed  unsuitable for wilderness to other uses. The agencies responsible  for managing lands need to have some certainty as to how they  should manage these lands.  Anaconda believes that continual wilderness study of RARE II  lands must be terminated and that the legal sufficiency of the  RARE II process must be statutorily affirmed.",,BENJAMIN COSTELLO,"ANACONDA MINERALS, CO.",Costello,Benjamin,h2d1,"costello, benjamin",,text

They are, in  fact, two of the real jewels of the Northwest.  I think it would be folly to log small portions of these areas. Let  me draw a parallel. What if, say, a community owned several  paintings worth millions of dollars. Would it be wise to slice out  portions of the paintings to sell them? No, because it would destroy  the value of the paintings as a whole. And to log selected portions  of these areas would bring small gain while ruining the areas as a  whole.  And, as the few remaining wilds in America are systematically  being developed, those which are left will increase in value.  Some people like to point out that Idaho already has more wilderness than any other State in the lower 48. They use this as a  rationale for not expanding the system. How unfortunate this attitude is may be seen in these parallels. Los Angeles has more movie  industry and New York more money exchange than any other  places in the Nation, but it would hardly be in LA&#39;s interest to prohibit more movie stars, or in New York&#39;s to limit the money markets. Each area must capitalize on the features which make it  unique.

By law, the Forest Service is to provide continous supply of  timber for its citizens; by law, the Forest Service must receive at  least minimum value for its timber; by law, the Forest Service     must appraise timber to determine the minimum acceptable bids;  and by law, the Forest Service must consider other resource values  in its management programs. The public must keep in mind the  appraisal value or the advertised rate of the timber sales is merely  a place to start the bidding.  The fair market value of the timber sale is established when the  bidding stops and the sale is sold. That is usually many thousands  of dollars beyond the point where the bidding starts.

On a recent forest tour, a representative of the Forest  Service told me that good forest management meant cheap lumber  for America. It sounded good or at least it did until I realized that  this is not the year 1783, and our continent does not have what  then seemed like an endless supply of trees. I began to wonder if  cheap lumber was a blessing. Cheap commodities tend to be used  thoughtlessly. We consumers feel that if we can afford it, we deserve it, regardless of the consequences.  Forested wilderness, like Long Canyon and Salmo Priest, represent such resources, ones which money can buy. Maybe if lumber  were more expensive, people would realize the terrible sacrifice our  country makes to supply it. But cheap lumber means we must provide a continuing, assured supply of trees even if it means moving  machinery into once quiet, untounched valleys and cutting halfcentury or three-century old monuments to America&#39;s past.  Long Canyon&#39;s trees represent lVfe to 2 years&#39; worth of work and  lumber in Boundary County or 1 Vz years&#39; worth of security for the  forest industry. But what then? Long Canyon, is roaded, cut, and  replaced, no longer a part of nature s scheme, but part of man&#39;s  management plan.  If the timber industry needs cheap resources that it has to lay  even a finger on the last natural drainage in our north Idaho Selkirk Mountains, then it&#39;s in trouble. And if it so badly needs to assurance of IV2 years&#39; worth of wood for Boundary County mills,  then management, not of the trees, but of the industry itself look  like the answer.  When water provided cheap hydropower in the Northwest, our  rivers were dammed, and destroyed as natural, free-flowing resources. Our folly of cheap river power is repeating itself with  213  timber. It looks like the ethic and economics of conservation of forests is an idea whose time has come.  My challenge to Senator McClure is to be a pioneer in forest conservation, to introduce legislation to give incentives to Americans  who build smaller homes, who recycle paper and other wood products, and who reduce the amount of needless cardboard packaging.

There have been a few statements made to me in the last few  years concerning the wilderness issue about why the mining industry is now interested in lands which are currently roadless.

We are not restricted to the  past uses of the land which were environmentally compatible.  These lands that we are looking at todayâ€”and you&#39;ll notice in the  bibliography of my statement there are three articles which I wish  would be entered into the record which assess the mineral potential of these landsâ€”we are now looking at these lands with the  hope of assessing that mineral potential on the basis of improved  technology.

Thank you, Senator. My name is Jay Mitchell.  And I am here today as the chairman of the Public Lands Committee of the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association. RMOGA&#39;s position has three basic components. First, mineral resources are potentially as important as surface resources. Second, the continual  wilderness study of the RARE II lands must be terminated and the  legal sufficiency of the RARE II process must be statutorily affirmed. Third, and certainly the most critical component of any  balanced wilderness legislation is language providing for the per261  manent release of lands determined to be unsuitable for wilderness  designation. It continues to puzzle us that there is so much controversy over this issue; the permanent designation of some land as  wilderness and the permanent release of some land as non-wilderness from continuous wilderness study. Lands placed in wilderness  remain so in perpetuity. It seems only reasonable that lands unsuitable for wilderness also be returned for multiple use until Congress decides otherwise. If we have permanent wilderness, then we  should have permanent release. We have soft wilderness as proposed by the preservationists, then perhaps we should have soft release.  Turning to oil and gas to illustrate what we&#39;re really talking  about, the production of oil and gas resources does not require a  large amount of land. If all the land used for energy and mineral  production in history were added up, this acreage would constitute  less than one-half of 1 percent of our total land base. The amount  of land used for oil and gas development is a fraction of even this  small amount. Finding oil and gas is truly like &#39;looking for a  needle in a haystack.&#39; Large amounts of land need to be explored  to locate these rare concentrates of mineral resources. And locking  away areas before they are explored raises the possibility that vast  mineral resources will be foregone by a wilderness designation.

I would like to appear again at such time as the Senator introduces his Federal Anti-Billboard Control Act. And I&#39;d be glad to  testify in support of that.  In the limited time allowed, my testimony will be directed wholly  in support of soft release in whatever bill is introduced relating to  Idaho wildnerness.  As you and others campaigning for office have noted, the Federal  Government makes mistakes. In my view, the causes of the major  mistakes have been irrevocable commitments based upon inadequate or biased data. The greatest peacetime error may be the  WPPSS fiasco. There are similarities. The decision to build five nu289  clear plants was a decision for development just as would a decision be to put logging roads into all the remaining roadless areas.  Now you know, as most of the conservationists knew and said back  in 1975, that it would have been far wiser to build one plant at a  time. So it would also be wiser to log only those areas where the  timber harvest makes economic and environmental sense.  Today there are few defenders of President Carter&#39;s decision to  impose a wheat embargo upon the Russians after the invasion of  Afghanistan even though this hard line received nearly unanimous  support at the time.  Private businesses are just as capable of making mistakes based  upon inadequate data and bad planning. For example, those  lumber companies that ran up the prices on Forest Service sales 3  to 5 years ago have been seeking a Federal stay or bailout to relieve them from their folly in paying too much money for too much  timber.  It is said that a soft answer turneth away wrath. Soft release will  turn away wrong.",,SCOTT REED,NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY,Reed,Scott,h2d1,"reed, scott",Afghanistan (COUNTRY),text

I wish to speak in defense of all wilderness in the Panhandle National Forest, in particular, Long Canyon. From information I&#39;ve  read, Long Canyon is the last major unroaded drainage in the Selkirks. We women of the Sandpoint Civic Club wish to go on record  as protectors of this unique and beautiful area.  313  Idaho is second only to Alaska in wilderness area. This may seem  excessive to some people but not to us. We treasure our wilderness  areas and want to keep them as they are. There are many myths  presented by people wanting the timber from these lands. Myths  such as no hunting, no fishing, no mineral claims. These activities  are allowed in Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management  wilderness areas. Hunting is prohibited in national parks. At this  time, mineral claims may be staked until December 31, 1983, and  existing claims may be developed.  I have recently visited the State of Maine where I was born and  grew up. I was appalled at the condition of much of the timberland  there. There is a very small national park on the coast of Maine,  Acadia National Park. This is the total Federal land in the State of  Maine. We don&#39;t want that happening in Idaho. There are some  State owned lands in Maine, but the majority of the forest land is  privately owned. In the area I visited, the forests have been slaughtered. This is the type of desecration I do not want to see happen in  our Panhandle Wilderness. I am not a newcomer to Idaho. I have  lived here 26 years. And this I consider my home. The Sandpoint  Civic Club wishes to go on record to save these areas.","Thank you very much.

The barren islands of Greece were once heavily  covered with forests. Surely similar issues were discussed and con322  sidered in that democracy some 2,500 years ago long before that  last log was cut by the last woodsmen for the last ship build from  the last good timber of that ancient land. They then proceeded to  removed the forests of the coast of Africa with similar enthusiasm  permitting the Sahara a firmer foothold on that now-desolate land.  What have we learned from this and hundreds of other similar experiences? We&#39;ve learned that we&#39;re not really good at learning the  lessons of history. Granted, of late we&#39;ve replaced the meat ax for  the surgeon&#39;s scalpel. And that helps. But it&#39;s not enough to maintain a primevil forest in its initial splendor.

Senator, I notice there&#39;s some confusion with respect to the areas involved in Long Canyon. And I think the ranger  of the Bonners Ferry district would be the best source of information for accurate data on that.  Today I want to discuss the relationship of caribou with wilderness. I&#39;m a professor of zoology at the University of Idaho and a  charter member of the International Mountain Caribou Technical  Committee. This commitee was formed in 1971 to promote the protection of Selkirk caribou.  I&#39;ve been asked several times whether we could manage caribou  under a modified multiple-use system. And my answer would be  this: We could. And this would be if and only if we had control over  access. And this is something that&#39;s been emphasized already  today.  This access permits poaching. And some of this I&#39;m sure is unintentional. We nave people that can&#39;t recognize caribou from elk or  deer. But I&#39;m sure some of it is also deliberate. And I have confirmed four mortalities in British Columbia caused by poaching  since 1977. Now, this sounds like a very small number of caribou  for that many years. But we have to recall we&#39;re working with a  334  small number of animals. And, also, we have a low opportunity of  recovering such kills.  Something that hasn&#39;t been stressed here today is strict law enforcement. We have laws protecting these animals on both sides of  the line. We need funding and we need encouragement from our  Members of Congress to provide us funding at the Federal level so  that we have such things as caribou gordons. And we might even  need deputies during the fall when it seems like most of this mortality occurs.  Lastly, we&#39;ll need the cooperation of the Canadians because some  of these animals live in Canada. And I&#39;m pleased to say that they  have made considerable progress there inâ€”the Canadians with  road closures and even experimentally closing one area where  we&#39;ve had some caribou mortalities.",,DONALD R.

I&#39;ve lived in Bonner  County for the last 23 years. And in my spare time, I run a small     newspaper operation in Bonner and Boundary County. I appreciate  the opportunity to present the views of the commission on roadless  areas and wilderness legislation.  In the national forest emphasized at this particular hearing, the  commission specifically recommends wilderness classification for  the roadless areas designated as A1981, Salmo-Priest in the Panhandle National Forests and the four Mallard-Larkin areas in the  Panhandle in Clearwater Forests.  The Salmo-Priest area encompasses the upper Priest River which  is the primary spawning and rearing stream for large bull trout  and west slope cutthroat from the Priest Lake system. Wilderness  designation would preserve the quality of this aquatic system and  limit access to minimize poaching of spawning fish. This area also  contains habitat that supports our only known caribou population.  This species has recently been designated as endangered under  Federal classification.  The roadless areas in the Mallard-Larkin complex comprise the  best roadless elk unit remaining in region 1, including summer, intermediate, and some winter ranges. They provide the only substantial area for back country quality hunting and the only large  scale potential wilderness available for the residents of the five  northern counties. The mountain peaks and ridges support a base  population of approximately 150 mountain goats which has provided at least 80 goats for transplanting to other goat habitats  throughout the State since 1961.  These areas contain major tributaries of the Little North Fork  and St. Joe Rivers which provide excellent stream for fishing for  wild trout.  354  The Commission also take the position that any State Wilderness  bill should not include the so-called &#39;hard release&#39; wording. If release wording prohibits future considerations of wilderness classification, the Commission then recommends that certain roadless  areas listed by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game be assigned to the category of further planning under the RARE II.

As a member of the Lower Coeur d'Alene River Outdoor Association, I would like to testify at this hearing on the importance of  saving our national forests and classifying these lands as wilderness. There is only one Idaho. And we have to preserve as much  land as possible for wilderness. We need foresight and hindsight  when it comes down to choosing our wilderness lands. We just  want to make sure that this land is held for future generations to  enjoy and use.  These are critical areas needed by our fish and wildlife. Without  wilderness designation, they will shortly be roaded.  I would like to urge you, Senator McClure, to include in your legislation the endangered wilderness core. I would also urge you to  use the soft release language in this bill. We definitely do not want  a ban on future wilderness consideration for any areas not classified now.  I would also urge you, Senator McClure, that at least 50 percent  of the remaining 6.5 million acres of Forest Service roadless land  be protected in your legislation.     I would strongly request that the Idaho Department of Fish and  Game wilderness proposal of 558,000 acres be changed to wilderness classification. I strongly feel that we need this land for wildlife management.  At the same time, I would like to see the management rules of  wilderness lands be changed so that fish and game would have  more control concerning improvement on fish and wildlife habitat.  Three points concerning this are prescribed burning, stream  management, and use of helicopters to land and survey by officials  of fish and game and Forest Service personnel.  Thank you.",Thank you.

I&#39;d like to strongly support the preservation of these lands for  wilderness area within the Selkirk Crest-Long Canyon area and on  the Mallard Lake-Larkins Peak area. I&#39;ve had the privilege of visiting those.  I was born in Coeur d'Alene. I&#39;ve worked in the communication  industry for 26 years.

I&#39;m here to implore you to seriously consider not acting quickly  in opening these areas up. They were created roadless. I see nothing to be gained by doing something hastily or under the guiseâ€”  under the guise of alleged unemployment or economic hard times. I  honestly fail to see the evidence that our hard time now is contributed by an issue of whether we&#39;ve locked land up or put restrictions on it. We know better than that. I see that we could also reverse decisions should this Nation need that lumber and need those  minerals.  But the other States would give a right arm or a left leg for what  we have here.

My name is Pat Barclay. I&#39;m here on behalf of  Congressman Craig to participate in the Idaho wilderness hearings  and listen to the citizens of Idaho speak out on the wilderness issue  for Idaho.  Idaho now has 3.8 million acres of congressionally designated wildernessâ€”more than any other State except Alaska. Idaho also has  the most extensive wilderness system and wild and scenic rivers in  the United States, encompassing 501.3 miles, along with two national recreation areas totaling 1,416,000 acres. This speaks very  highly of our State&#39;s ability to provide a wilderness experience for  its citizens.  Wilderness is one part of the whole concept of multiple use of  our natural resources. Wilderness is a resource. Tourism is a growing industry in the State. It is approximately the third largest industry in Idaho. However, the visitation to wilderness areas is only  7 percent of the growing tourism industry. The bulk of our tourism     industry revolves around access to areas having transportation facilities, housing accommodations, and easy accessibility.  Another resource which needs to be discussedâ€”considered when  discussing the issue of wilderness is our children. As parents, we  Idahoans strive to insure that our children receive a good education and have equal opportunity to obtain employment. Future jobs  for our children must be a consideration as we discuss the disposition of the public lands in Idaho. Will our young have the opportunity to seek employment in our State, or will they have to leave  and find jobs elsewhere? Idaho&#39;s children are a resource too valuable for Idaho to lose. The future of our children makes the decision  about the wise and balanced use of our natural resources one of the  most important that will be made.  The process of evaluating the uses to which Idaho&#39;s lands may be  put has gone on for years. Even before the first roadless area and  review evaluation process started in 1970, wise use of Idaho&#39;s natural resources was studied and debated. Continuing indecision and  confusion can only serve to erode our economic base and waste taxpayers&#39; dollars.  The management of public lands is a question which deserves an  answer. Our future as Idahoans hinges on the decision which could  be made affecting our public lands. More is at stake than simply  protecting or developing an area. Idaho&#39;s future is at stake.

I&#39;m Norma Dobler, State senator from district 5.  And I&#39;m speaking today on behalf of myself.  And I&#39;d like to thank you, Senator, for giving the people of our  State this opportunity to express our concerns about the disposition  of resources which we hold in joint ownership.  When making any type of investment decision, I always draw up  a cost-benefit statement setting forth the positives and negatives of  each alternative in order to obtain that all-important bottom line  which indicates long-term cost benefit. Of course, each area must  be analyzed individually. And there will be some variations in results. But general items of paramount importance must be discussed.  First, let&#39;s look at the alternative of the multiple-use classification of wilderness in terms of total income to the State&#39;s economy  as opposed to its costs. Tourism is Idaho&#39;s fastest growing industry,  competing with the timber industry for second place in economic  importance. Last year 4 million visitors generated more than 1 billion in income in the State and employed 25,000 people. Tourism in  Idaho is very closely tied to the availability of a wilderness experience. For instance, avid hunters from out of State pay in excess of  $2,000 each to hire a guide and spend a week or so in the back  country. Backpackers and fishermen spend hundreds of thousands  of dollars for equipment and supplies. Any subsidy the taxpayers     put out for wilderness use such as itemsâ€”such items as trail maintenance and fire suppression is minimal. Fish and wildlife management is generally paid for through licenses and use fees.  Wilderness classification offers protection of priceless watersheds. That value for the drainage of the middle fork of the Salmon  alone is estimated at $7 million per year and is of equal importance in other areas.  These are truly multiple uses with positive, measureable economic values that allow for perpetual natural renewal of our resources.  Now let&#39;s look at the other alternativeâ€”opening up thousands of  acres to logging. Most of the area under consideration is fair to  poor in potential timber productivity, difficult as to access, and  highly subject to erosion from roadbuilding. Logging operations  would severely damage recreational opportunities and cause great  monetary loss to related industries as well as loss of jobs in those  industries.  I&#39;ve seen a recent analysis on the Jersey Jack timber sale in the  Nez Perce National Forest, which revealed that it produced a deficit of 4V2 million on this sale alone because of the high costs of the  road construction. This is, in reality, a public-supported subsidy to  the industry.  Timber is rightfully regarded as an important renewable resource. But in some of the areas under consideration, it really is  not renewable and must be considered akin to an extractive industry. In many of the areas in question, the growth period is 75 years  or even more. Industries dependent upon harvest from these areas  must compete with the Pacific coast where the timber resource is  renewed in 20 to 25 years and with the Southeast where it is renewed as quickly as 15 years for some varieties. More than one409  third of all the public forest lands in the State are classified as low  site. When low-yield sites are brought into production, tax-supported subsidies are required in order to meet the competition.  The taxpayers of Idaho, as well as the rest of the Nation, have  grown weary of subsidizing industries. When we subsidize the  timber industry, we are depleting a resource that takes many years  to renew, if indeed it ever can be renewed. And at the same time  we are damaging other industries and preventing them from  making a profit.  Senator, I sincerely trust that you will carefully examine a costbenefit analysis before committing the taxpayers to further subsidizing an industry that does not have immediate need for the product that would be harvested at such great public expense; compute  the costs to the taxpayers in terms of road construction, soil erosion, depletion of the watershed, and losses to other industries of  importance to the economy; and compare that bottom line to the  income that could be derived from harvest of the timber. Such an  analysis may signal a green light in some limited areas. But in  some places like Kelly Creek, Mallard-Larkin, the Selkirk Crest,  and others, the light will undoubtedly indicate stopâ€”or at the very  least a big caution.  Of course, the timber industry is important. But so are the other  concerned industries. And we must consider the greatest gift for all  people.     I would suggest that a wiser solution for supplying the recognized future need for timber would be to concentrate on better  management practices in order to increase the yield on the more  productive forest lands. If memory serves me right, two-thirds of  the productive forest land in Idaho is in smallâ€”in private ownership, mostly in small woodlots. And there areâ€”there have been  proposals made to help those people. And if you would help them  in order to do a better management job and increase their yield, it  would then leaveâ€”make it possible for use to preserve for posterity  these last wilderness treasures. A decision to commit an area to exploitation is irreversible.

I&#39;m Joe Hinson, executive director of Idaho Forest Industry Council. And I&#39;d like to  speak just almost extemporaneously over the discussion about release language. We&#39;ve all heard various definitions of hard versus  soft, and it&#39;s been somewhat confusing.  From the timber industry standpoint, what we would like is language that releases the Forest Service from having to further address roadless area questions. These are the wilderness, the nonwilderness through the planning process. We are in effect making  those decisions right now with this legislation. We have done the  necessary study through RARE I, RARE II, and this discussion at  some point simply has to come to an end. And we are saying that  the release language that we seek does represent the end to that     particular discussion.  Let me make it clear that we certainly feel that Forest Service  planning process ought to consider the other range of appropriate  management activities on the national forest, including recreation,  wildlife, timber, minerals, and grazing, and that nothing that we  propose would preclude the rights of future Congresses to designate  wilderness. Obviously that cannot be done. We wouldn&#39;t think it  would be desirable anyway. If economics change, if public opinions  change, if there is new knowledge that supports additional wilderness designations, then certainly future Congresses are free to  make those decisions. But in the absence of those decisions, our position is that the Forest Service should consider the wilderness  issue closed with the passage of this legislation and proceed with  orderly land-management decisions based upon the plan for each  national forest. That&#39;s what we really need to stabilize our national  forest land base as far as the growingâ€”continuous growing and  harvesting of timber crops is concerned.  Thank you.","Thank you, Joe.

I&#39;m Todd Maddock, regional director of public affairs for Potlatch Corp. I reside here in Lewis ton.  I am here today in behalf of the Idaho Forest Industry Council.  The council represents 24 member companies making up more  than 90 percent of Idaho&#39;s forest products industry. We appreciate  411  the opportunity to appear before you and express our views on possible legislation to both designate wilderness and release nonwilderness areas for multiple use.  You will find attached to my statement the Idaho Forest Industry Council proposal which calls for the addition of 591,628 acres to  the Idaho wilderness system. In that proposed legislation, we offer  language that will legally release for multiple use the remainder of  the roadless areas. This release language does not preclude other  areas from being considered for wilderness in the future. But it insures that other nonwilderness uses can proceed without fear of  appeal.  It must be remembered that about half of the national forests of  Idaho are roadlessâ€”over 10 million acres in total. Of that 10 million acres, 3.8 million acres have already been congressionally designated as wilderness giving Idaho the largest wilderness system of  any State, except for Alaska. Thus, 38 percent of the roadless areas  have already been permanently set aside.  The forest products industry recommends completion of Idaho&#39;s  wilderness system by selecting from the remaining 6Vz million  acres those areas having the greatest wilderness value while minimizing the adverse impact on the State&#39;s economy. Adding almost  600,000 acres to the State&#39;s wilderness system will mean that  nearly half of the national forest&#39;s roadless areas of the State will  become permanent wilderness leaving the remainder to provide     continued employment for Idahoans.  The roadless areas of the national forests represent a critical portion of the State&#39;s productive timberland. The annual timber  growth of the roadless areas equals one-fourth of the State&#39;s average annual timber harvest. Unless the U.S. Forest Service is allowed to proceed with planned timber sales within the roadless  areas, the present capacity of the forest products industry in Idaho  cannot be maintained.  I have attached for the record a recent study prepared by the  University of Montana in cooperation with the Intermountain  Forest &amp; Range Experiment Station. That study indicates that our  industry is second in economic importance only to agriculture accounting for a full 25 percent of the nonagricultural economic base  of the State. Our industry is also based upon a renewable resource.  Thus, given the opportunity, it can remain a mainstay in Idaho&#39;s  economy as long as we will allow it to be.  Thank you.",,TODD L.

We feel that your hearings, and your direction, and what&#39;s  needed to resolve this problem are a main concern as a user of  Forest Service resources, timber, which account for some 40 to 50  percent of our sawmills&#39; needs has to be addressed. We feel that if  this timber is not made available under a multiple use that sawmills such as ours will not be in existence much longer in Idaho.  We feel that the 100 and some people directly dependent upon us  deserve the right for an economic future in Idaho. We strongly  urge release language that will allow those areas not designated as  wilderness to be brought back in the Forest Service planning process and to be orderly developed.

And I am  responsible for the purchase of all timber for Potlatch in Idaho.  I would like to get a little specific regarding the Clearwater. The  forest covers approximately 1,839,000 acres of which at the present  time almost 500,000 acres are set aside for either wilderness, scenic  river corridors, research natural areas, recreation sites, cultural  and historic sites, and on and on. Our industry recommendation for  wilderness additions to the Clearwater would add 57,000 acres to  this total for approximately 550,000 acres, almost a third of the  entire forest off limits to timber management.  Will this mean the remaining two-thirds of the forest will have  the benefit of timber management as one of its uses? No, sir.  As you know, these hearings are partly in response to getting the  Forest Service planning process back on track. This planning process has identified almost 600,000 acres where management decisions will be geared toward roadless recreation, roadless fishery  management, special watershed management, winter and big game  summer range management, et cetera. Even though the cloud of  wilderness may be removed on some of the above areas, we remain  skeptical given the present appeals process that a dependable  timber supply from the Clearwater Forest will come from those     areas.  The problem of stall and delay used so expertly by our wilderness advocates through the appeals process in the courts is the primary reason we ask you to develop some kind of language that will  allow those areas that have been released to be developed and  managed in a reasonable fashion.  Finally, Senator, there&#39;s been a lot of reference made to the quality of life for our children. I have three children. And their quality  of life depends on the fact that I remain employed.

Mr. Hitchcock. My name is Richard Hitchcock. I own and operate Gem State Lumber Co. Gem States operates a sawmill in Julietta, Idaho, which directly employs 55 people. And our mill is a  major employer in Julietta. Our continuing operation depends on a  reliable supply timber from the Clearwater National Forest. Currently, about 40 percent of the wood we convert comes from the  Clearwater National Forest.  Gem State Lumber strongly supports the IFIC proposal for additions to the wilderness system and the release of nonselected areas  for return to the forest-planning process.  Rather than focus on the details of the industry proposal in the  Clearwater National Forest, I would like to address one specific  issueâ€”road funding. Proponents of huge wilderness withdrawals  would like the public to believe that roadless-area development  constitutes a taxpayer subsidy and roadbuilding where costs exceed  the value of timber harvested, violates congressional intent. Both  contentions are pure fiction.  The Forest Service uses two basic road funding methods: (1) purchase credit and (2) congressionally appropriated fundsâ€”so called  hard money.     Most Forest Service permanent roads are built with purchaser  credit. Purchasers build roads to Forest Service specifications in exchange for credit toward the purchase of the timber after paying  cash for statutory base rates and regeneration costs. Purchaser  credit is compensation for providing the Government with a permanent asset at a cost estimated by the Government. Often actual  costs exceed Forest Service estimates. This extra road construction  cost is borne by the purchaser. A deficit sale purchased at appraised price has no effective road credits. And the purchaser constructs the road at his own expense. If there&#39;s any subsidizing  going on, it&#39;s the timber purchaser subsidizing the Federal Government&#39;s acquisition of an asset.  Hard money roads are paid for with appropriated funds. Applicable statutes and legislative history show the intent of Congress is  twofold. First, to create road systems with standards exceeding  those needed for immediate timber harvest in order to satisfy environmental, safety, recreational, long-term management, and other  needs. Second, to insure that forest do not unduly rely on purchaser credit and, in the process, reduce county government revenue  from timber receipts. Congress recognizes that roadbuilding is directly tied to environmental issues and the Federal Government&#39;s  obligations to county treasuries.  This road funding issue takes on special significance on the  Clearwater Forest where less than a third of the forest is roaded.  Prompt resolution of the wilderness issue is the first step toward  selection of those areas in the forest that will be roaded and  become part of a stable timberland base.","Thank you, Mr. Hitchcock.

I&#39;m Larry Biasing. I&#39;m acting exeuctive  director for the Inland Forest Resource Council.  There have been a lot of statments over the last three hearings  about whether or not the industry is being subsidized by the Government through the timber-sale process. I would likeâ€”including  statements by Senator Dobler. I would like to attempt to dispel  that myth and point out that these statements actually have no  foundation. In fact, the appraisal that the timber process that the  Forest Service goes through where they advertise timber sales is  simply a place to start the bidding. The market value that&#39;s established for these timber sales is established after the bidding process  takes place.  I would like to just briefly run through the process that the     Forest Service goes through. First they determine an estimate of  volume and quality of the timber they&#39;re going to sell. And then  for this they establish an end-product value. After establishing that  value, they then subtract the cost for manufacturing, for logging,  hauling, and the other operational costs that exist. After that&#39;s  done, then they make an allowance for profit and risk. And what&#39;s  remaining is essentially stumpage. And that&#39;s a very simplistic example.  After the stumpage is valued, the timber-sale contract requires  the purchaser to build roads. And for that they get stumpage  credit. Now, a deficit sale is a timber sale where the estimated  value of the timber is such that the Forest Service or that the purchaser has estimated that he will get less than 75 percent of the  normal profit ratio that he should expect from the sale. The Government gets stumpage. They get minimum stumpage. They get  this by law.  As a part of this process in the building of roads and management of this, the timber sales, the Forest Service completes a part  of their long-term management program. They have residual  values that they gain from building roads. And, in addition, they  receive a long-term asset in the form of the roads that are built.  The risk is entirely with the industry. The Forest Service tells us  when we bid on these timber sales, look fellows, you&#39;re probably  going to get less than your normal profit ratio. But if you want to  go ahead and build theâ€”bid on these timber sales, feel free to do  so. In most cases, timber sales are bid far and above the break-even  point to where there&#39;s a positive product margin.  428  So the risk is entirely with the industry. There is no risk to the  Government. And if there is the unlikely event that there is any  subsidy, it is actually the industry that is subsidizing the Government and not the other way around.","Thank you Mr. Biasing.

My name is Dave Edgerton. I am general manager of Wickes Forest Industries&#39; sawmill at Grangeville.  Since passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, Congress has established slightly in excess of 3.8 million acres of wilderness in the  State of Idaho. All the wilderness areas except the Sawtooth wilderness area are contained partially or totally within Idaho  County. The boundaries for the wilderness areas were arrived at  after many years of study, hearings such as this and many hours of  debateâ€”both on the local and congressional level.  Through this processâ€”particularly as it pertains to the Nez  Perce National Forestâ€”many compromises were reached, often to  nobody&#39;s particular satisfaction. Some parties felt that different or  additional acres should have been added to the wilderness system.  Others felt that far too many mineral-rich lands and commercial  forest lands were included in the wilderness system. Because of, or     in spite of, these differing opinions the wilderness boundaries, as  we know them, were established. As part of the tradeoff to establishing these boundaries, the remaining acreage on the Nez Perce  Forest were essentially released for multiple-use management.  While the timber industry and timber dependent communities  were not happy with the results produced by our Congress, we at  least naively thought that the land withdrawal issue had been resolved on the Nez Perce Forest and we could not go about planning  our activities around the timber to be produced on the remaining  acres. Such has not been the case. We have instead had the ninth  circuit court tell us all of the last 12 or 13 years of study and meetings and compromise were insufficient, we have had appeals and  lawsuits challenging Forest Service activities in the supposedly released roadless areas, and we have had others propose that an additional large block of the forest be set aside in the form of a National Recreation Area.  The basic foundation for Idaho&#39;s economy is the bountiful trove  of natural resources we find within the State. The State and its  people cannot prosper if too much of its resource are withheld from  development. The timber industry can neither prosper nor make  the necessary investment to stay efficient unless there is assurance  of a continuing supply of timber from Federal lands. At Grangeville we have mothballed one facility employing 40 people because  of timber supply problems. At Riggins 65 people lost their jobs because uncertainties over timber supply precluded the owners from  making the investment to rebuild at that location. Our own mill in  Grangeville has been for sale for some time but has not soldâ€”the  stumbling block of course isâ€”long-term timber supply.  429  In summary, we believe that Idaho Country and the communities  like Grangeville have already contributed all they an afford to contribute. We ask that no further land withdrawls of any sort be  made on the Nez Perce National Forest.  Second, in order to end the confusion we now have regarding  timber sales and timber availability, we ask that Congress declare  the RARE II EIS legally sufficient and that Congress specifically  release the remaining roadless areas on the Nez Perce for multiple  use management.  Thank you.","Thank you very much. I have a couple of ques-

tions. Mr. Boling, you skipped over a portion of the testimony with

respect to the release language. It deals with the concerns about

what happens if as a matter of fact there is no release and no reso-

lution and we are stalled in court. Hold a mike over, and tell us

and tell the audience why it is the industry is concerned about re-

lease language.

Mr. Bolling. Well, the primary reason we&#39;re concerned about re-

lease language is that because of the numerous appeals that can be

legally submitted for the timber sale process of Clearwater or any

other forest, they never reach the auction block. And in particular

the Clearwater, although this process will allow them to continue

with their forest plan. The forest plan may never see the light of

day because of this appeals process. And if these lands then are re-




leased as a result of this legislation and are not given some benefit

of being able to be managed in a reasonable fashion, 8, 9, 10 years

down the road it&#39;s not inconceivable we will not have a forest plan.

And will those lands that have been so-called released by consid-

ered for wilderness again? And obviously they have not settled the

question.

The Chairman. So what you seek is some way of making certain

that you don&#39;t go from where we are today to a second round or a

next round

Mr. Bolling. Absolutely.

The Chairman . Wilderness study without the oppor-

tunity to have some forest unit planning process conclusion in the

meantime?

Mr. Bolling. That&#39;s absolutely correct. And that&#39;s been the, you

know, that&#39;s been the problem ail along.

The Chairman. Could anyone at the table, off the top of their

head, recite the total mill capacity in the State of Idaho?

Mr. Hinson. It&#39;s just over 2 billion feet. It perhaps has dropped a

bit over the past couple of years. But it&#39;s probably right at the 2

billion feet level and in normal years&#39; production is just under 2

billion feet.

The Chairman. I noticed, Mr. Maddock, in your statement you

indicated in 1979 the harvest was 1.850.

Mr. Maddock. Yes; Senator McClure, I&#39;m Todd Maddock with

Potlatch Corp. The average annual harvest on log scale for the last

10 years has been 1.6 billion board feet. That&#39;s varied from near 2

billion down to a low of maybe 1.2.

The Chairman. Now, we get timber from a variety of sources,

Federal lands, State lands, tribal lands, and private land holdings.

Mrs. Dobler indicated earlier we should use more intensive man-

430

agement, and that we should also shift to small woodlots. I noticed

in your statement, Mr. Maddock, that you indicated that the

supply coming from private timberlands has increased from 547

million board feet in 1969 to over 800 million board feet in 1979. I

assume that the private timberlands means all non-Federal and

non-State; is that correct?

Mr. Maddock. Yes; it does.

The Chairman. How much of that increaseâ€”well, maybe I

should ask it the other way around. What proportion of the private

timberlands is in small woodlots?

Mr. Maddock. That figureâ€”I don&#39;t have that information. Per-

haps one of the other panel members might recall that number.

Mr. Hinson. It&#39;s about half.

The Chairman. About half?

Mr. Hinson. Right.

The Chairman. In that period that was identified from 1969 to

1979, that decade, did the proportion of timber coming from small

woodlots increase proportionately to that of other types of lands?

Mr. Hinson. I don&#39;t have the exact figures, Senator McClure. I&#39;d

be happy to furnish those for the record. But my guess is that they

did; yes.

The Chairman. All right. Thank you all very much. I have no

further questions.

Senator McClure, besides the normal multiple-use  benefits of wilderness, there are other good things that come from  it. Outfitter jobs and recreation jobs are the fastest growing segment of industry in Idaho.  Wilderness offers some sense of permanence, some feelings you  can come back to the same place you&#39;ve been visiting for years and  still find it the same.  It permits endless waste of taxpayer money on single-use timberhaul roads, roads like those in Toboggan Creek, planned for Minnesaka Creek, plan in the head of Fish and Hungry Creeks on the  Lochsa, and in the Lochsa breaks of Elk Summit.  Those kinds of roads are bad business. The road industry would  never build if they had to spend their own money doing so.  Wilderness designation recognizes the low level of current knowledge about our public lands and leaves most of all possible options  open. It can be reversed whereas roadbuilding cannot.  Wilderness also accomodates most fully one of the finest of all of  American dreams. And that is that our children might be smarter  and even wiser than we are and leaves for them some of the pleasures of decisionmaking.  Wilderness is a good and beneficial thing in Idaho and so is the  timber industry. And there&#39;s no doubt that we need to sustain that  industry in our State.  For our part as far as Idaho Environmental Council, I certainly  can place our fullest cooperation of the Clearwater National Forest  to maintaining historical timber-harvest levels. That means  making whatever compromises are needed to do that. That&#39;s 170 or  431  180 million board feet. Doing so won&#39;t be easy. If your goal is toâ€”  and I think it ought to beâ€”to maximize these wilderness decisions  on the Clearwater and still keep timber-harvest levels up, we&#39;ll  need to do it very carefully and take some time to do so.  The only numbers in timber supply that are worth much to the  Clearwater come from the for plan run for the Clearwater forest  plan. There is virtually no specific day of that forest. And it&#39;s not  possible very easily to say that Mallard-Larkins&#39; designation as wilderness means this many jobs for this industry and that many  fewer for another. The for plan numbers for the Clearwater Forest  purports to show that historical timber levelsâ€”timber-harvest  levels could be exceeded oh the existing roaded land base. No one  believes that. Industry does not. And certainly the conservation  groups don&#39;t. There are some possible solutions. One of them is to  access and try to find perhaps the best 200,000 roadless acres on  that forest looking for the best timber sites, use the $40 million  which the Clearwater National Forest had planned on for building  roads everywhere in the forest to reach those 200,000 acres and  perhaps as Senator Dobler suggested, use some of that vast sea of  Federal money that seems to be around to better manage the existing high-quality sites on the Clearwater National Forest. That  would be fewer road engineers and fewer roads. It would be many  jobs of a labor-intensive sort.  This kind of approach to management of the Clearwater Forest is     not currently being studied by the forest and will not be unless you  make it do so. They don&#39;t think that way. They plan the extensive  development of the forest rather than intensive.  It would also mean that places like Kelly and Cayuse Creeks  could be left as they are now and no road be built to the high areas  of Elk Summit.  I urge that thinking and compromise on you.","Thank you very much. The attachment to your

Than you, Senator.  My name is Richard K. Linville. I represent the Salmon River  Breaks Association. This association is an asociation of landowners,  outfitters, hunters, and fishermen from the Salmon River breaks  country in central idaho.  We&#39;re concerned primarily about the Jersey Jack and Big Mallard roadless areas in the Nex Perce National Forest.  Our association has proposed that the Jersey Jack and Big Mallard roadless areas in central idaho be designated by Congress as a  national recreation area. NRA legislation is appropriate and desirable for these two roadless areas for the following reasons:  One, the recreation values of these roadless areas, including wildlife, fishery, and scenic resources, warrant the protection that  would be provided by national recreation area legislation. The  Salmon River breaks currently provide some of the best bighorn  sheep habitat in Idaho. The deer and elk hunting seasons in this  area are the longest in the State. The big-game herds are so plentiful that controlled hunts have never been required by the Idaho  Fish and Game Department. The excellent water quality in the  area supports native cutthroat, steelhead, and salmon fisheries.  The Idaho Fish and Game Department has endorse our proposal     for a Salmon River breaks national recreation area. The roadless  and undeveloped character of the Salmon River breaks has provided the people of idaho and of the United States with excellent  back-country recreation opportunities since before Idaho was a  State. These recreation resources deserve to be protected for the  future.  The second reason that should be classified as an NRA is the existing commercial outfitting and guiding businesses located within  the proposed NRA are profitable and growing. They are an asset to  the economy of the State of Idaho. An economic impact study that  was completed in 1981 indicated that the gross income from these  activities was approximately $800,000 during that time and expected to grow to $1,360,000 within the near future. The Idaho Outfitters &amp; Guides Association at its annual meeting this year endorsed  our proposal for a national recreation area.  The primary reason this area is so popular with big-game hunters is that it is unroaded. The big-game herds are strong. And they  will continue to remain strong as long as the access is curtailed.  The third reason that marketâ€”that NRA&#39;s legislation is appropriate for this area is that the market value of the timber in the  Salmon River breaks is much lower than the cost of construction  roads to bring the timber out to the mill. A professional forestry  consultant has examined the economics of logging the roadless  areas using data provided by the Nez Perce National Forest. In his  analysis, this economist used the highest bid price ever recorded in  the Nez Perce National Forest as stumpage value for all of the  timber in these roadless areas. Even with the assumption of this  extremely high timber value, his analysis indicated that the net  439  loss to the Forest Service from road construction would be over $2  million. The net loss from administrative cost would be $1,296,000.  And the net loss from road maintenance costs would be $587,000  â– with a total net loss of over $4 million.

Mr. Robertson. Good morning, Senator. As a businessman I am  appreciative of your leadership and support for the President&#39;s programs to move this country back to economic well-being. The excesses of past programs and policies now face us with the potential  for staggering billion-dollar Federal deficits. This whole issue of  forest and wilderness is timely given your need to address Federal  agency funding whose programs comprise these deficits.  The reason that vast roadless areas remain in Idaho is economic.  It is the result of geography and climate. In order to make a profit,  the timber industry in central Idaho has had to contend with poor  access, steep slopes, highly erodible soils, slow regeneration, and in  many areas the thin distribution of commercial saw timber. They  have also seen that the poor economic health of Idaho&#39;s timber industry is caused not by a shortage of timber from national forests,  but the same economic factors which have affected America&#39;s other  basic industries, such as, steel, autos, and coal. Economic conditions  have forced timber companies to reexamine their competitive position in a changing marketplace. Given the constraints of high labor  costs, harvest costs, obsolete equipment, long distances to market,  low productivity of forest land, and low return on investment, is     there any reason why Idaho timber companies should not be expanding their operations in the Southeastern United States?  Where does that leave the timber industry right now in central  Idaho? Current Forest Service practices of offsetting marginal  timber sales with road credits will continue to keep some people  employed for the near term. Welfare of any form only alleviates  the problem. It cannot cure it. Subsidized timber harvests kept  people employed at the Riggins sawmill. But when disaster strikes,  the economic realities come to bear and the mill cannot be rebuilt  at today&#39;s costs and investors&#39; need for a competitive return on investment. So where are we?  First, we need to get the real facts on roadbuilding and future  maintenance costs, sale administration costs, harvest costs, regeneration costs, dollar losses to fish and wildlife habitat, and put the  return to the Treasury on past sales in the Clearwater and Nez  Perce Forests.  Second, we need to review and strengthen if necessary the in  progress joint State/Federal economic study of the value of biggame herds and anadromous fisheries in Idaho.  Third, through the Idaho Tourism Board, we need to plan and  conduct a study to measure the economic impact that tourism and  recreation brings to the Idaho back country and the potential  where we could competitively market this resource.  Fourth, based on these findings, objectively and unemotionally  we need to evaluate these roadless areas with a determination for  the highest economic return given the potential for profitable  timber sales, mining, outfitting, and guiding, and other recreation.  461  Fifth, this is not a political numbers game of so many acres of  wilderness. We must accept that so many acres such as Jersey Jack  and Mallard Creek are not suitable for profitable timber operations, nor does the area seem to fit the criteria for wilderness. A  national recreation area seems to be more appropriate.",,EDWARD I.

Thank you, Senator.  My name is William Johnson. I reside here in Lewiston and represent the Clearwater chapter of the Idaho Conservation League, a  group of local citizens living most of us here in the valley. Because  we do live here, we are particularly sensitive to the stability of the  timber industry. Though I don&#39;t work at Potlatch, in a sense my  job nonetheless depends on that stability. By the same token, we do  not feel that the designation of significant lands in the Clearwater  National Forest as wildernessâ€”significant acrease as wilderness is  necessarily a threat to the stability of the timber industry.  I would reiterate what has just been said about economic  demand as opposed to supply being perhaps the primary problem  right now for that industry. With 12 percent considered right now  a low mortgage by most home buyers and the average home in the  United States costing something like $96,000, it&#39;s hard to see how  the demand for saw logs is ever going to be what it was in the sixties or the seventies.  I would urge the committee to consider theoretical and philosophical considerations as well as practical and economic ones.  Works such as Roderick Nash&#39;s &#39;Wilderness in the American     Mind' just seems to me are just as significant as road cost benefit  studies.  Finally, timber is theoretically a replenishable resource. I would  like to believe that it always will be. But if I might be allowed perhaps an off-beat analogy, so are whales considered a replenishable  resource. If you look at what the whaling industry has been up to  over the last hundred years, you discover that several species have  already been eliminated and several more are now threatened with  extinction.  I think one perhaps unusual argument for wilderness is that it  will help the timber industry protect itself from its self and not  eliminate itself. Significant wilderness will make industry more  prudent in taking the long-termâ€”not a short-termâ€”but a longterm look at Idaho&#39;s natural resources.  Finally, I would like you very much to see the issues resolved.  But I would also hope that wilderness review would beâ€”would  remain an option for future generations.

Since we are asked to be specific, I have a picture we took in  1980 near the summit of Mount Scotchman which was taken without aâ€”this is taken with a regular lens, not a longâ€”long-distance  lens. And it shows a mountain goat which is very rarely seen, especially that close. And Mount Scotchman is northeast of Lake Pend     Oreille. And it fortunately is in one of the proposed areas for in the  Forest Service and the Forest Industry Councils proposals. It&#39;s impossible for this species to exist where roads are within a rifle  range as they make such a tempting target whether it&#39;s legal or  not.  The other Saturday morning I listened to Todd Maddock being  interviewed on KOZE-FM. And he stated that Potlatch Corp. can  manage their forest on a sustained yield basis but the Forest Service cannot. Why not? Sustained yield in our forests that are already roaded is the real answer to our need for timber.  Thank you.","Thank you.

I am the secretary for the Nez Perce  Tribal Executive Committee, which is a governing elected board of  our people. So because of the unique relationship that we have  with the U.S. Government, I feel that I can say that we are talking  from one Government representative to another Government representative.  We have like many other people concerned recognized the vital  importance of concern for preservation and protection of these  areas as being the last of our natural resources. Fish and wildlife  habitat faces the continuous onslaught of human greed and mass  destruction. Many of us have come to recognize the costly damage  and extermination of nature. During our lifetime we have seen the  useless way of destruction of our resources that have become so inevitable that unless mankind wakes up, the controlled exploitation  of what is left will dictate a serious situation of greater shortages  than we have now. Because of the uncontrolled sound management  of the society, we, the Indian people, have suffered the impact of  bad publicity in the eyes of the public media . .1 exercising our sovereign treaty rights. The shortage of fish and wildlife has been fo   cused upon the American Indian as the prime source still ignoring  the facts that the manmade devices and uncontrolled multiple use  concepts. We have become a political tool in degradation of our  treaty with the United States. We realize our Congress has recognized the importance of clean air and clean streams that must coexist with man when it enacted the Environmental Act. Yet we  have allowed such protective legislations to come under the influence and pressure of large political powers and special interest  groups who have tended to dilute these protective provisions which  in reality were designed for the best interests of the American citizen.  We have learned that man is destroying the very things that has  nutured him at a rapid pace. Our history has taught us that what  is not actively protected is lost. All of us in this room have seen the  gradual destruction of nature as man encroaches upon what is left.  My people are mindful of the importance of our children that  they d enjoy the nature and what she had to offer in the same  manner that we were fortunate enough to enjoy.  The Nez Perce Tribe has no choice but to support more wilderness as a last resort as a means of protecting our treaty rights on  conservation of nature&#39;s valuable assets since all other management efforts or practices have seemed to fail and are still yielding  to man&#39;s greed because he has become a slave to his machines. And  I would like to remind the Senator and those present that I was  present in the Washington, D.C., hearing when I heard arguments  that if we do have wilderness, you&#39;re going to shut out the timber  for production in the sawmills. The sawmills are going broke. The  wilderness billâ€”the present wilderness bill was enacted by Con489  gress and signed into law. The very same sawmills not too long  thereafter had to close down not because of the wilderness area but  because of the marketâ€”the slump in the market and construction.  This was the cause for shutting down the sawmills.  And, Senator, I wouldâ€”I had more to say but because of essence  of time, we again would like to strongly emphasize that these areas  you are speaking of has a significant historical cultural and religious values to our people as they are directly related to our treaty  with the U.S. Government.",,ALLEN SLICKPOO,"SECRETARY, NEZ PERCE, TRIBAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE",Slickpoo,Allen,h2d2,"slickpoo, allen",United States (COUNTRY); Washington (STATE); Washington D.C.

I am executive secretary of the Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho, Inc. In average times we represent over 700 companies engaged in the logging business in the State of Idaho. These  companies employ somewhere over 10,000 employees and harvest  approximately 75 percent of the logs in the State of Idaho each  year. And that harvest figure historically, Senator, has been  around 1.7 billion board feet of logs a year.  In the past 12 years, we have been involved in numerous hearings concerning wilderness in the State of Idaho. We have testified  at the Snake River Break Recreation Area, the Gospel Hump Wil   derness, as well as the RARE I and II to name a few. After the  RARE II hearings, we felt that the answer to the definition of  either wilderness or roadless or multiple use would be provided  once and for all. After the recent Ninth Circuit Court decision  which states that insufficient consideration was given to wilderness, this position obviously has been drastically changed.  We appreciate your time and effort in allowing us to appear  before you to hopefully assist you and your committee in making a  decision that is vital to everyone in this State. I would like to make  a few points that I believe are necessary in the decisionmaking  process. Almost without exception every logger that I know in the  State of Idaho is at heart a true environmentalist and not a preserationist. He would like to have a job to earn a living for his wife  and family, buy equipment, parts and supplies to make that living  with, pay taxes both income and property tax and in the process  provide a vehicle for the taxation of the operating timber sales to  the counties in which he is working. These taxes from the timber  sales are delivered to the school system in the State of Idaho,  which allows the children of the State of Idaho to be provided an  educational opportunity second to none. He also wishes to see the  quality of life that we have enjoyed in the State of Idaho, continue.  He wants to see high pristine mountains and lakes, quality fishing,  and of course the wildlife that is so much a part of this great State.  In addition to this, he enjoys berry picking and the scenic grandeur  which also is a part of this State. The timber industries&#39; position in  my opinion has been very carefully put together. And the addition  of approximately 600,000 acres to the already established 3.8 million acres of wilderness is a very viable position. In the timber in500  dustries&#39; proposal, the remainder of the roadless areas under question in most cases is ordinary everyday type of forest land that for  one reason or other just simply does not have roads in it. I suggest  to you, Senator, and the members of your committee that you  adaptâ€”that you adopt, excuse me, the timber industry&#39;s proposal  and let the great State of Idaho get on to its mission in life affording each and everyone of us a great place to live and many, many  of us a place to make a living. I would attempt to answer any questions you or the committee might ask of me. And, again, thank you  for this opportunity.","Thank you.

During the past years, I have put much time and effort  and money building my logging contracting business. I employ between 10 and 15 men with a monthly payroll between $25,000 and  $30,000. These men depend upon the purchase of significant  amounts of timber to furnish them with jobs. I, in turn, depend 100  percent upon national forests to provide me with readily available  supply of timber to make my living, to support my family, and  enable me to employ these men.  If more land is closed to logging, I feel it will be only a few short  years before I will no longer be able to purchase enough timber to     run my business. We&#39;ll be stuck with a lot of expensive equipment  for which I have no further use for and will have no way of making  a living to support my family. And we&#39;ll have 10 or 15 employees  and friends who also will have no way of supporting their families.  I feel that the above will also be true of a large number of other  people in Idaho that depend upon the national forest for a living. I,  therefore, urge that no more land in Idaho be set aside for wilderness or roadless areas but that all remaining lands be designated  as multiple use so that all Idahoans have an equal chance to use  and enjoy and to make a living from these lands.

As a company, we employ 5 to 30 people each year who all live in  the State of Idaho and 95 percent in Clearwater County. We have  an average payroll of approximately $300,000 per year which 98  percent comes from the construction of roads for timber companies  and the U.S. Forest Service. I feel the Forest Service with their  501  present method of building roads are doing a good job. They are  going to great measures to protect streams from excessive sediment  with their filter methods. I wholeheartedly believe in multiuse for  our Federal forest and do not want to see any more forest locked  up and not put to productive use.  Senator, I would like to present to you some photos of actual construction being done on two different projects in the Clearwater  Forest.

I am certainly not opposed to preserving scenic areas, but I cannot condone letting our natural and renewable resources die and go to waste. I have seen millions of  board feet of valuable white pine timber go to waste in areas outside of designated wilderness areas because of environmental restraints for unfounded reasons.  I believe it would be much wiser to develop the potential timber  producing areas in an orderly, economically and ecologically adequate fashion instead of waiting until there is a natural disaster  502  such as Fire or bug infestation and then develop the areas in an escalated and haphazard fashion to salvage the timber.

My name is Don MacKenzie. And I&#39;m presenting testimony for the Grangeville Chamber of Commerce.  The Grangeville Chamber of Commerce is made up of 103 members representing the business community of Grangeville. The economics of Grangeville and Idaho County are strongly dependent  upon the forest products industry. Our county road maintenance  program and financing for our public school systems depend heavily upon 25 percent of fund receipts from national forest timber  sale.  The Nez Perce National Forest contributes a substantial share of  the timber needed to supply our sawmills with raw material. The  current annual harvest level on the Nez Perce National Forest is  approximately 100 million feet. This allowable harvest volume contributes to the support of five sawmills. Planned harvest levels for  the forest depend upon the availability of commercial forest lands  included in all roadless areas on the forest. Failure to obtain quick  release of these areas for multiple-use management will result in a  drastic reduction of timber volumes offered for sale by the Nezperce National Forest.  Failure to achieve legislation to establish the sufficiency of the  RARE II environmental impact statement and to make a reasonable land allocation of the roadless areas in Idaho to either wilderness or multiple use management will result in a catastrophic blow  to the timer based economy in the State.  The potential threat to the economy of Grangeville and Idaho  County is not theoreticalâ€”it is real, Senator McClure. The Grangeville Chamber of Commerce urges you to seriously consider these  503  recommendations which we submit to you. One, no further wilderness acreage should be dedicated from the Nezperce National  Forest; two, release all roadless areas addressed by the committee  language of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act; three, release all  roadless areas included in previous unit plans; four, release the  Salmon Face roadless area 1-855 and Rapid River roadless area I922; five, with regard to other roadless areas the State: (a) exclude  all commercial forest lands from wilderness proposals, especially  with regard to the Mallard-Larkin roadless area 1-300; (b) exclude  all areas with high mineral potential from wilderness proposals;  six, release of roadless areas from wilderness consideration should  be permanent.  The Grangeville Chamber of Commerce believes it is time to end  the uncertainty as to how national forest lands are to be managed  in Idaho. A decision must be made soon as to whether roadless  areas will be managed as wilderness or released for multiple use  management. Our sawmills and mines must know what lands will  be available to contribute present and future supplies of raw materials. A reasonable and fair Idaho release bill will not only provide  for wilderness protection for remaining high quality wilderness  candidate areas but also assure the economic survival of timber dependent communities such as Grangeville.

Senator McClure and members of the committee, my  name is Richard Law, president of the Lewiston Chamber of Commerce.  The Greater Lewiston Chamber of Commerce is very much interested in seeing the wilderness issue resolved. Our local economy  and future growth is dependent on the settlement of this vital  issue.  I have no comment on specific areas or sites that should or  should not be designated wilderness. The chamber does not endorse  or support any group or industry plans. And we have no solutions  for solving the dilemma.  However, I am here ot impress upon you, the committee, and  Congress as a whole, that wilderness areas are not economic assets.  They do nothing for the communities surrounding them compared  to what multiple use would do. I will let the timber industry speak  for themselves and focus on theâ€”and I will focus on the recreation  industry.  Our chamber staff recently did a survey on tourist inquiries that  have come into this office in the past 2 years. This is some 5 years  after the formation of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area     and designation of large amounts of wilderness in the Nez Perce  National Forest. And Lewiston is the largest of the gateway cities  to that area. Over the 2 years we received in that office 713 inquiries regarding the national forest areas. And of these 713 inquiries  received at the office, only three asked about the wilderness areas.  There were two additional letters asking about hiking. And there  were two more that asked about horseback packing into the areas.  Those seven letters indicate that about 1 percent of the potential  visitors who were interested in visiting a wilderness area. The vast  majority or 99 percent wanted to visit the NRA by road or by boat.  While we don&#39;t keep records of visitors to the office that just walk  in and out, the results would be very much the same. The overwhelming majority of Americans want to visit the forests without  having to backpack into a wilderness area.  The situation of foreign tourists is even more pronounced.  During the past few years the chamber has entertained several  tour organizers from Europe. There is a great interest from those  people in the Americanâ€”from those people in the American West.  However, there is no interest from tour operators in getting off of a  paved road much less walking into a wilderness area.  While the U.S. Forest Service may estimate a demand for wilderness around large population centers, there is no great demand for  wilderness area in the hinterlands. Some people in metropolitan  areas may want to create more wilderness in Idaho, but they obviously do not want to visit them.  The State of Idaho through a 2-percent motel-hotel room tax has  embarked on a $700,000 advertising program to attract tourists to  the State. It has proven very successful.  508  Thank you, Senator.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator. I also appreciate this opportunity to testify. I am a resident of Orofino, Idaho. Harriet Barker,  and at this time I, represent the Women in Timber. I do have a testimony I would also like to read.  The Clearwater Chapter of Women in Timber has 18 active members, which comprises 72 people, that depend solely on the timber  industry for their livelihood.  We have studied and listened about the RARE II roadless issue  in the Clearwater area and desire to strike a balance between what  should be wilderness and what should be multiple use. The primary factor is to have adequate timber that these people can raise  their families without degrading them to receiving unemployment  more than the weather dictates. As long as this issue remains in its  present state, not one of these families can make plans for the  future. Their land of promises is a constant frustration.  509  One specific family has bought land and tried for the past 6  years to start and build their first home, but by the time fall rolls  around it&#39;s always maybe next year. In 1982 the father worked IVz  months.  Our people live and work here in Clearwater County and enjoy  the hunting and fishing just like the tourists. They pay their share  of taxes and contribute to the community.  In the Clearwater area, Orofino is the largest town which depends entirely on the timber industry for its payroll. To consider  the money spent by the loggers for rubber, insurance, fuel, food,  clothing, and recreation is to see a town dry up without it.  When a person thinks of adding more wilderness to the 3.8 million acres already set aside, it&#39;s like taking x number of areas and  saying they no longer exist in the United States. We think Congress does not mean to do this.  It is vital that these roadless areas be settled permanently. We  are sure after 20 years of study Congress can vote on a bill that is  acceptable for timber management and wilderness without more  tax burden on the taxpayer.  The Clearwater Chapter of Women in Timber do not want to see  a RARE HI study or $30 million more spent. We propose to have  Idaho drawn back into the main stream of the other 49 States, so  raising and educating a family, enjoying the scenic beauty, and recreating how we choose, and being able to share the wealth and     burden that makes this country the greatest on Earth.

And we at Getty appreciate this opportunity to  testify today.  We do not quarrel with the concept of the wilderness system.  Indeed, it is desirable to preserve some of our Nation&#39;s lands in  their natural state. In fact, the Federal Government has already  done so with nearly 80 million acres of U.S. lands.  However, we believe that any wilderness legislation should mandate that all Government-owned lands considered for inclusion in  the wilderness system should first be assessed for their mineral  and hydrocarbon potential. Only then can intelligent choices be  made between the value to society of developing the natural resources on those lands and the value to society of preserving the  land in its wilderness state.  We believe that our industry has compiled an outstanding track  record in exploratory drilling on Government lands. It has been  demonstrated repeatedly that such drilling can be conducted with  only temporary and minimal impact to the surrounding environment.  Moreover, once the exploration is completed, it is required that  the land be returned to its natural state.  Therefore, we believe that the cost of exploration in wilderness  study areas is a small price to pay when compared to the benefits  510  that could be achieved through the development of that land's resource potential.  Those benefits include jobs and economic activity related to exploration and production, royalties to the U.S. Treasury and greater domestic production of minerials and hydrocarbons.  Further, we strongly support placing permanent release language in any wilderness bill declaring that once an area has been  judged not to have wilderness characteristics, it may not be considered again and will be managed according to multiple-use principles.  If this is not done, large tracts of valuable lands will remain in  limbo indefinitely and the potential uses for those lands will be  needlessly sacrified. Permanent release language will remove any  ambiguity about the future status of such lands and allow the  agencies charged with their management to implement long-range  plans for multiple uses.  For the record, Getty geologists have identified those areas on  the Forest Service RARE II map for Idaho that they believe have  mineral or hydrocarbon potential. I have attached a list to this testimony giving specific areas and tract numbers.  This illustrates a simple fact about our industry. In order to find  and develop new reserves for future generations, we must explore  where the geology is favorable.  We cannot afford to wait for a crisis to occur, before we decide to  lands.     permit an inventory of the mineral resources on our Government  The leadtime required to explore for and develop mineral or hydrocarbon resources is counted in yearsâ€”not weeks or months.  The American people deserve a policy which will put Government-owned lands to their best use. We believe that permitting a  mineral and hydrocarbon assessment on potential wilderness lands  and permanent release language for areas judged not to have wilderness characteristics are two steps in that direction.

Thank you, Senator. I am currently visiting associate  professor of wildland recreation management at the College of Forestry of the University of Idaho.  First I would like to express a word of appreciation to you for  your personal and professional interest in forest wilderness. Certainly the very process of conducting this series of hearings will  prove beneficial in illuminating and clarifying the values of wilderness and in identifying the location of wilderness areas worth  saving in national forests here in Idaho.  I would also like to say how pleased we are, Senator, that you  will be with us at the first National Wilderness Management  Workshop at Moscow in mid-October. You will be interested to  learn of the enthusiastic response to our program and that we  expect an attendance of more than 200 policymakers, wilderness  managers, leaders of industry and environmental organizations  from all parts of the country.  For more than 20 years I have been a student of wilderness and  forest policy, writing about them in books, magazine articles and  columns, and in spoken presentations at symposiums and lectures  before professional and university audiences.  Often I&#39;ve been asked:  Well, how much is enough? With how much wilderness will you finally be satisfied? How much is enough? How much of the Nez Perce and Clearwater National  Forests, with which we are specifically concerned today, can I logically recommend  be allocated as wilderness?  513  But these should never be the questions, for wilderness cannot  and should not be separated from scientific forest management  based upon the principles of multiple use. Multiple use is a valid  and a sound concept, a design to protect and perpetuate public forests, while utilizing their resources wisely in the interests of all the  people.  However, multiple use has not been practiced widely on our  public forests. It is not being practiced today. The funding imbalance places the emphasis on commodity production. Among multiple uses, watershed protection, recreation and wildlife hold low priority.  The National Forest Management Act of 1976 was intended to  make multiple use work at last. That law called for equal consideration of all renewable resources in an optimal mix. However,  timber production quotas, now called targets, are delivered to  forest supervisors, who then transfer the burden to district rangers.  Of course, there is a planning process, but it fails to deter or deflect  the commitment to single-use production.  Reasonable land stewardship includes the protection of soil,  water quality, and fish and wildlife habitat. So declared F. Dale  Robertson, now associate chief of the Forest Service, in 1974, when  he was supervisor of the Siuslaw National Forest, following a  period of logging abuse and resource degradation. Robertson  pledged as follows: &#39;Short-term economics will not override long   term needs of high quality land management.&#39;",,DR.

Thank you. I&#39;m very happy to be here and  happy to see that your interest in wilderness is still there today.  In the issue update that I received from you, one of the things  stated in there is that Idaho has more national forests than any  other State and the largest wilderness system outside of Alaska. Of  course, you&#39;re right. And these very facts suggest two important  things that should not be forgotten.  First, we are talking about National Forests, a resource that does  not belong to just us Idahoans. But rather a resource that belongs  to the entire American public and future generations.  Second, the very fact that we have the largest wilderness system  of any other State outside of Alaska is something that Idaho is  proud of. It has helped maintain our State as a place to live where  the quality of life is high, a place for tourists to visit, a place where  they can still find that wildness in wilderness of America.  In the last several weeks we have all seen articles in local newspapers stating that opinion polls of Idaho residents show that the  majority do not favor more wilderness. Editorials have questioned  the validity of polls. But no one has really brought up the fact that  the wrong public is being asked the questions.     If we go to a study done in the State of Colorado in 1980, we find  that 84.1 percent of that State&#39;s population would be willing to pay  for wilderness preservation.  This one small example suggests that we cannot just look at this  time from the perspective of Idaho. It is also here that I as a citizen  expect you, Senator McClure, to draw on your ability to evaluate  this issue from a national perspective. Consider those national  issues. Consider how important this land, that we are so lucky to  have in Idaho, is to the rest of this Nation.  The second item which I wish to focus on here is Idaho&#39;s image of  a wild place. In our tourism promotion for this State, every regional travel committee talked of Idaho&#39;s wilderness and wild lands as  a key attraction for their area. As Idaho&#39;s $1.1 billion tourism continuesâ€”tourism industry continues to grow, it is extremely necessary that we maintain our image. Of course, not all tourists spend  all their money and all their time in the wilderness. But, after all,  should we complain about those who fish the waters that exist in  our Nationâ€”some of our Nation&#39;s wilderness? For these people pay  money to the resort owners, the State receives economic benefits,  fish and game receive license, fees, Idaho taxes are collected by the  States, dollars are spent for gasoline food and souvenirs, let alone  the direct benefits that our outfitters and guides receive from wilderness.  Wilderness is a very important economic industry in the sense of  both recreation and tourism. If we look into Idaho s future and we  believe the U.S. Commerce Department projection about this segment of our economy growing, if we believe the projections made  by futurists about tourism becoming the world's largest industry by  517  the year 2000, if one realizes that wilderness is a scarce commodity  throughout the world, then it seems to me that the question of wilderness in Idaho and how much we need should be reduced to a  question of how much can we get without drastically affecting the  other segments of the economy.","Thank you very much.

Senator, I am John Varley, representing the Idaho  Chapter of the American Fisheries Society. We are a State organization of a national parent society composed of professional fishery  biologists. In the essence of time, I will keep my comments brief  concerning the Clearwater National Forest. Further information  will be submitted as written testimony for the entire State on  behalf of the State chapter.  The Clearwater National Forest has some of the best remaining  fish habitat left in the State of Idaho. It supports drainages that  have the pristine qualities for producing abundant populations of  native cutthroat trout, steelhead, and chinook salmon. These populations are being continually stressed by further environmental  degradation through sediment produced from road construction,  hydropower development and fishing pressure, whether sport or  commercial. Continued population strength is becoming more and  more dependent upon quality habitat that can yield fish at maximum potential.  We support three major drainages in the Clearwater National  Forest for wilderness status, to insure the protection of fish habitat. These drainages include Kelly Creek, tributary to the north  fork of the Clearwater, Fish Creek and White Sand Creek drainage,  both of which drain into the Lochsa River.  Kelly Creek has the reputation of being one of North America&#39;s  finest streams for producing native westslope cutthroat trout. The  Department of Fish and Game&#39;s management strategy of catch and  518  release only has paid enormous dividends in the form of enhanced  fishing opportunity. This management technique has afforded excellent population stabiliity, but its continued success is dependent  upon the present habitat which produces high quality water. Research data shows that the unroaded sectionâ€”or the unroaded portions of the drainage support three times the cutthroat trout than  sections with roads. Fishing pressure has steadily increased in the  area since the inception of the regulation because of the enhanced  opportunity to catch more and larger fish.  Water quality in Kelly Creek is presently being seriously threatened by development plans to road portions of the Cayuse Creek  drainage. The short term benefits created by a highly subsidized  timber sale in this area would certainly be a net social and economic loss for the residents of the State and nation.  The Fish Creek drainage has been termed the Sistine Chapel of  the Clearwater steelhead production by researchers. This year&#39;s  survey data indicate even further increases in the stream&#39;s steelhead population which is now approaching a natural carrying capacity. The continued success of wild steelhead populations in the  Clearwater River are becoming more and more dependent upon  drainages like Fish Creek.  White Sand Creek in the Elk Summit area of the upper Lochsa is  the most important producer of wild chinook salmon in the Clearwater drainage. Chinook salmon are presently struggling for their     very survival in Idaho.  The Idaho Department of Fish and Game&#39;s fish management  plan calls for maintaining all three drainages at 100 percent of potential with no degradation in water quality to protect fish habitat  and their populations.",,JOHN VARLEY,"IDAHO CHAPTER, AMERICAN, FISHERIES CHAPTER",Varley,John,h2d2,"varley, john",Clearwater National Forest (FOREST); Idaho (STATE); Kelly Creek (STREAM); Clearwater (FOREST); Fish Creek (STREAM); White Sand Creek (STREAM); Lochsa River (STREAM); North America (CONTINENT); Cayuse Creek (STREAM); Creek (STREAM); Clearwater River (STREAM); Elk Summit (LANDFORM),text

I am Keith Stonebraker, a member of the  Idaho Fish and Game Commission. I appreciate the opportunity to  present the view of the commission on the remaining roadless  areas of the State of Idahoâ€”of Idaho and potential wilderness legislation.  In the national forests emphasized at this particular hearing the  commission specifically recommends the roadless areas designated  as Kelly, Hoodoo, and Moose Mountain and Cayuse Creek and Bighorn Wietas in the Clearwater National Forest. One of the major  resource values associated with this potential wilderness is the protection of the Kelly Creek watershed and the 1979 Forest Service  proposal falls far short of the area required.  Kelly Creek in its entirety is being managed as a catch and release fishery to provide an opportunity to catch large westslope cutthroat trout. The westslope cutthroat was on its way to extinction  about 20 years ago. And this has really been the turning point for  this particular species. The drainage is nationally recognized as a  blue ribbon fishery and considered by many to be one of the finest  in North America. Fishing intensity has steadily increased since  the inception of the catch and release regulation in 1970, primarily     because of the enhanced opportunity to catch fish.  Most of this virtually pristine watershed supports unexcelled  spawning and rearing habitat but is very susceptible to degrading  caused by sedimentation from roads and their construction.  The drainage is potentially being threatened by plans to bring  the Toboggan Creek drainageâ€”a very important tributary to  Cayuse Creekâ€”under management with roads. Both Toboggan and  Cayuse Creeks support essentiallyâ€”essential spawning and rearing  habitat for cutthroast trout. Any loss of habitat in those drainages  will ultimately affect Kelly Creek.  The drainage supports excellent elk range. And its present untagged and unroaded status enables the department to manage for  longer elk seasons and opportunities to harvest large bulls. Now,  this sentence I think is very important. It&#39;s really critical to use  because this undeveloped area along with the adjacent Weitas  drainage produces the largest harvest of bull elk in the State for a  single management unit.  So it&#39;s paramount that the entire Kelly Creek watershed be  maintained in its present status for protection of the fish and wildlife and recreational opportunities.  The commission also takes the position that any State wilderness  bill should not include the so called hard release wording. Therefore, if release wording prohibits future considerationsâ€”consideration of wilderness classification, the commission then recommends  that certain roadless areas listed by the Idaho Department of Fish  and Game be assigned to the separate category of further planning  as outlined under the RARE II procedures.  523  Mr. Chairman, the commission has judiciously considered the  State&#39;s remaining roadless areas and the implications of a State  wilderness bill.  We feel that our statement is very moderate, especially in consideration of the fact that we are even asking for less than the forest  industry is asking for. But we are emphasizing quality and not  quantity. And the selected few areas which are endorsed for wilderness classification have strong justification based upon the important fish and wildlife vales.",,KEITH STONEBRAKER,"MEMBER, IDAHO FISH, AND GAME COMMISSION",Stonebraker,Keith,h2d2,"stonebraker, keith",Idaho (STATE); Kelly Creek (STREAM); Hoodoo Great Burn (WILDERNESS); Moose Mountain and Cayuse (WILDERNESS); Creek (STREAM); Bighorn Weitas (WILDERNESS); Clearwater National Forest (FOREST); North America (CONTINENT); Toboggan Creek (STREAM); Cayuse Creek (STREAM); Toboggan (STREAM),text

Senator McClure, I&#39;ve been a resident of the  State of Idaho for approximately 8% years. I was raised in California. I did a lot of backpacking in the Sierras. I was a member of  the Sierra Club.  Over everything I loved the mountains. I was young, single, idelistic, and no responsibilities. I came to Idaho because I loved the     mountains and don&#39;t care for urban or even semi-rural life styles.  Elk City is rural rural.  I found and married my wife here, have had three children. I  have a good job. I found the place that I want to raise my children.  With one child with severe cardiac problems, I for sure have found  responsibility. I also still have my ideals and love for the mountains. Reality falls somewhere between idealism and meeting responsibilities. For me, use of the Nez Perce National Forest falls  also between ideals and responsibility, the responsibility to maintain a strong economic base where I live in Elk City, in Idaho and  the United States. And the ideals of having everything in a pristine, untouched environment both are needed.  For this reason, I feel that a multiple use approach to most of  theâ€”to the use of most of our national forests is necessary. We  have a large wilderness area. And we need to provide for our families now to get to tomorrow. That is the reason I recommend the  following: I want immediate and uncompromising release of all  lands released to multiple use development in the RARE I and II  studies that were not specifically set aside for wilderness. There  should be no compromise of the present boundaries nor further  study nor deferred status given to these areas. Some of the multiple use areas include Jersey Jack, Mallard Creek, Bargamin Creek,  Running Creek, East and West Meadow Creek, I would like this entered into the record.  And sitting here, I thought of a couple of other things. I know  this last year the timberâ€”I work in the timber industry. And there  was a possibility of my being laid off. And had the idea, I went out  and bought a small gold mining dredge, which there is other people  536  doing it. But at least in the Elk City area for the last 500 to 100  years people have been providing a way of life not only for themselves but for their families by being able to utilize the national  forests, whether it&#39;s with a pick and shovel and a gold pan or  whether it&#39;s cutting down firewood. There&#39;s an ability to make a  life for your family. And I know that you&#39;re incapable of doing that  in a wilderness areas. I like wilderness area. But there&#39;s no way  that even living there that I can make much use of that wilderness  area unless I can afford to have horses and the money necessary. A  lot of people that work where I work can&#39;t afford to take the time  off to be able to come to even hearings like this because of the job  and meeting the responsibilities that they have.  That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say. Thank you.","Thank you.

Thank you, Senator and to your staff, for allowing me  to sneak in earlier to accommodate a plane schedule. I have submitted formal testimony that includes mineral areas in the Clearwater and in the southwestern part of the State.  I&#39;d like to drop the formal testimony and speak aside for just a  moment. In most of the testimony, the issue of timber of other resources has been very well covered. But the issue of minerals is so  unclear because they simply aren&#39;t on the surface. They&#39;re not a  visible resource. And I hope that during the determination on what  should and should not be included that the body of data concerning  minerals will be brought forward and considered fully for the  reason that an acre of land in agricultural use may produce $100  or $200 per year in value where an acre of land average in mineral     production is in excess of $500,000 per acre per year. It&#39;s such extreme economics that I believe it deserves that special consideration.  Furthermore, the use of land in mining is an extremely small  use being less than one-sixth of 1 percent of the land area.

And they have some  just unbelieveable experiences that only an area like that can offer.

In the case of the U.S. Forest Service, we  must maximize the utilization of lands suited for the production of  wood and fiber, grass, minerals, recreation, or a combination of all  of the above.  Anytime you put land in wilderness you eliminate the possibility  of a positive economic return.  Last year my small logging company logged a little over 20 million board feet for gross sales of $2,830,000.

I want immediate and uncompromising release of all RARE I  lands released to multiple use development by individual unit  plans.

The real issue before us is economical. If t*ie areas close to Elk     City, Idaho, were the only areas in question on wilderness or no  wilderness, it would be one thing. But they are not. The whole  Northwest and/or areas that are timbered are in question. Though  I live in the Elk City area, I am directly affected by this wilderness  question. But so is the box boy in a supermarket in New York.  Your reply is how can that be? The answer is simpleâ€”America was  built on free enterprize. Any country that stops their raw material  output soon is destroyed economically.  Under the guise of saving the wilderness for future generations,  if this wilderness question goes to RARE III, it will have cost you  and future generations over $1 billion.  Our Government and Forest Service officials are most competent  and are now and have been doing a good job taking care of our forests. Groups of people who have been thwarting the logging industry are not helping America. But in reality are destroying it. I am  not deceived by their slogans save the forests for the future.  Again may I say the answer is simpleâ€”stop logging and you stop  America. Because everything depends on the logging industry. You  say know? All right, stop logging, home building stops, carpenters  are out of work, electricians are out work, plumbers are out of  work, cement masons are out of work, painters are out of work,  furniture manufacturers go bankrupt. And then pulp and paper  manufacturers go broke, no more wood chips, every office worker  in the United States loses hereâ€”no paper, no jobs. The question on  wilderness in Idaho Nez Perce Forest is too large for us, nor can I  be so selfish to think only of my little corner of the world.

Senator McClure, I&#39;m Ron Wise. I&#39;m from Pullman,  Wash. And I&#39;m representing the Palouse group of the Sierra Club,  which is in this area. I want to thank you for this opportunity to  present our views to you on this question of wilderness in Idaho.  The Palouse group is one of a number of environmental groups  in Idaho that are involved in determining those areas which we  feel should be classified as wilderness. As you know, we will have  our recommendations to you some time in October.  One area that&#39;s of particular interest to me personally that I&#39;d  like to mention here today is the area in the Saint Joe National  Forest that&#39;s called Grandmother Mountain. Most of us locally  refer to it as Marble Creek because that is the stream that is the  center part of this area. I was attracted to this area about 18 years  ago by the outstanding fly fishing I encountered there. During  these years, the fishing has ranged from excellent to terrible. In     addition to fishing, I have hiked and backpacked the entire upper  12 miles. According to local legend, there are some beaver ponds  with large cutthroat trout in them. And like the pot of gold under  the rainbow, the beaver ponds and lunker trout continue to allude  me. One of the problems with managing this area is that the  localâ€”the valley reaches are managed by the Forest Serviceâ€”  owned by the Forest Service and the upper reachesâ€”ridges by the  BLM. And so we have a problem thereâ€”a potential problem with  mixed management. And then, furthermore, we have some  inholdâ€”private inholdings. And I understand that there is a case  before the Forest Serviceâ€”a proposal to build a road into one of  these inholdings. So that&#39;s another problem. The thing that makes  this area unique in my mindâ€”and I think I&#39;m speaking for a  number of people in the area because I&#39;ve talked to people in  Moscow, for example, that said, &#39;I own Marble Creek.&#39; They feel  very possessive about it. It&#39;s only 75 miles from Moscow. And you  have a true wilderness experience in about a 2 hours&#39; drive. And  that&#39;s really something, I think, for this area because otherwise  you have a lot further to go.  We feel that wilderness is multiple use. Timber people frequently  say, well, we&#39;ll lock up this land into wilderness. That&#39;s its single  use. And we would like to disagree with that very strongly that  wilderness is multiple use. There are many uses involved in wilderness. And I would like to suggest that perhaps logging is a more  single use than wilderness itself is. I&#39;d like to suggest that if we  should ever be on the side of creating too much wilderness, Congress could certainly change this in the future.

But being as how I&#39;m the one that makes a living out of  that areaâ€”exact area, I wanted to come down here today and tell  you what I thought. It was my understanding when that was excluded in the wilderness proposal in RARE I and RARE II that  that would be then changed to the highest and best use by the  Forest Service. And in my opinion, the logging of that area is not  the highest and best use. There&#39;s about a half a dozen outfitters  and business people that use that area. We operate profitable businesses. We&#39;re not subsidized by anything of the Government and  nor do we ever want to be.  The thing, I guess, that gets to me the most is the fact that $4V2  million is going to be spent on that project at a loss to put me out  of business. And that&#39;s myself and another six, eight people formed  616  the Salmon River Breaks to try to bring about the fact that there  is a higher and better use for that area.  We&#39;re at a 6,000 foot elevation. We&#39;re lodgepole pine. That  timber grows on a 100-year cycle. And once this is cut into, it can  never be returned to our type of business.  I guess that is about the main extent of it there.

Senator McClure and members of the panel. I am Lee  Sisco, this is Don Dressen and Wilbur Stepp. We are owners of DDouble-S Outfitters, Inc. We come before this subcommittee wearing two hats; one as businessmen and the second as concerned  sportsmen and citizens of Idaho.  We don&#39;t have any recommendations for wilderness throughout  Idaho, but do have some specific requests for the Clearwater River  Drainage.  Our outfitting business is located on the Cayuse Creek Drainage,  which is a tributary of Kelly Creek; part of the North Fork of the  Clearwater River. Our request is that Kelly and Cayuse Creeks and  their tributaries, also known as the Great Burn Area, be designated wilderness in your upcoming wilderness bill.  At the present time, roads are being proposed and surveyed  through the heart of our outfitting area. If the roads and subsequent logging occurs, it will put us out of business. No way can we  survive with roads running the length and breast of Cayuse Creek.  Multiple use of the area means one thing and one thing onlyâ€”  roads and logging. Forest Service personnel in the area have frankly admitted to us that the timber value will not even cover the cost     of road construction. To make outfitting a viable business, large  areas of unroaded wilderness must be preserved. So, as a small  business, who&#39;s survival depends upon an unroaded wilderness, we  urge you to preserve the Great Burn Wilderness Area.  The second hat we wear is that of the Idaho sportsman. Kelly  and Cayuse Creeks are nationally ranked, blue ribbon Western  Slope cutthroat trout fisheries. Kelly Creek and its tributaries are  probably the finest completely natural Western Slope cutthroat  trout areas in the United States. We can&#39;t imagine even considering reading or logging and the subsequent silting that will occur to  a national treasure like this drainage.  Cayuse Creek has an abundance of other wildlife that should be  protected by the wilderness designation. Cayuse Creek and tributaries support between 800 and 1,200 head of elk, both summer and  winter. Moose are also abundant, and are on the upswing due to  the remoteness of the area according to the Idaho Fish and Game.  Also, whitetail and mule deer, plus black bear are plentiful. One of  the last grizzly bear sightings in the Clearwater drainage was on  Cayuse Creek. Our hunters last season saw two wolves which indicates the need to leave the area unspoiled. Obviously, if the area  will attract a small wolf population, this is a good indicator of the  wildlife supporting ability of the region.  Idaho has a chance to preserve a resource that could be lost forever; god is not making more wilderness. We can&#39;t believe that the  preservation of the Great Burn Area will make a drastic change in  the economy of Northern Idaho. Remember, in the 75 years since  the big burn, harvestable timber still has not regenerated. After  it&#39;s logged, what do we do for the next 120 years.  633  Idaho is called the gem State; mining and logging may be gems  now in the State, but outdoor recreation is the brightest of the  stones. Without preserving the most valuable gem, wilderness,  Idaho will loose its brilliance.  So, again we urge you to preserve the Great Burn Area. Thank  you.","Thank you. Mr. Dressen?

My name is Brad Johnson. I am a family physician  at Valley Medical Center in Lewiston, Idaho, where I have practiced for the last 4Vfe years. I am also an avid and active bow  hunter by avocation and am currently the director for the Idaho  State bow hunters in the northern part of Idaho. I am also the  region II director for citizens against poaching program of the Fish  and Game Department. I would like to testify both on behalf of  myself as an interested sportsman and also on behalf of the Idaho     State bow hunters.  As a bow hunter I have spent a great deal of exciting and enjoyable times in the Clearwater National Forest and I share this experience with many others in the sport of bow hunting. The Idaho  State Bow Hunters is an organization of approximately 1,000 members throughout Idaho. We feel we represent the most concerned  and active of the bow hunting fraternity and our organization is a  nonprofit one, dedicated to the preservation and progress of ethical  bow hunting in the State. The Idaho State Bow Hunters have a  track record of energetic and positive conversation activity in the  past. An example of this was our reward for reporting poaching activity, which preceded the citizens against poaching program by  many years. Also, the Idaho State Bow Hunters were one of the  leading organizations working to prevent changes in the highway  12 corridor, which would have been detrimental to the wildlife of  the region. We feel that the current controversy on the designation  of wilderness in Idaho&#39;s roadless areas is very important because of  its potential impact on Idaho&#39;s wildlife. More and more, habitat is  the key issue in wildlife survival and maintenance of healthy populations, with Idaho&#39;s roadless areas representing the best of the remaining habitat. We wish to make sure that wildlife is one of the  foremost resources considered in any decisionmaking.  The Idaho State Bow Hunters have no forestry or biological experts per se as advisors. We do, however, trust and depend on organizations such as the Idaho Department of Fish and Game who do  possess such expertise for guidance in what is best for our wildlife  resource. We would urge that any decisions as to the designation of  wilderness areas be made in consideration of the recommendations  32-427 0- 84 41  634  by competent wildlife authorities so that critical habitats can be  maintained; particularly in areas where there is uniqueness of the  qualities of the environment or where there exists a foothold for an  already threatened species such as the wolf.  Further, the Idaho State Bow Hunters would like to join others  in calling for restraint and caution in the move to finalize any designation of land use in Idaho&#39;s forest and other public lands.  Trying to be overly comprehensive may lead to premature decision  on various areas which are difficult to change later. Certainly this  would seem to be happening in the aftermath of the Alaska land  use bill where now groups from both sides of the issues are having  trouble living with the restricted designations. The Idaho State  Bow Hunters are one of the groups which are reluctant to have  once and for all type decisions made precipitously on Idaho&#39;s forests and we feel that any permanent decisions need to be approached slowly and cautiously because of the difficulty in modifying them in the future.  Bow hunters, like many other sportsmen, appreciate and use the  access of the outdoors which is provided by logging activity, but  this does not seem to be our threatened commodity. We currently  are seeing as more precious the areas which give us satisfaction because of the challenge to reach them, the lack of human impact  there, and because of the reservoir they provide for wildlife.  Thank you.","Thank you very much. Many of you know the

Kelly Creek area, the Cayuse, and the Toboggan areas far better

than I do. I know from the testimony of others and from the map

that there are some roads that go through that area now. Would

you care to comment?

Mr. Sisco. Lee Sisco, D-Double-S Outfitters. There&#39;s one major

road that goes from Kelly Creek over the top to Cayuse landing

strip. From there it goes clear over the top to the Lolo Trail and

down the other side. It butts into the highway. There&#39;s a couple of

small spur roads that go along the old Lewis and Clark Trail for a

ways. And they go to a couple of old, burnt out lookouts that are

there. And that&#39;s about it.

At the present time, there is a 15-man or 20-man survey crew

working the whole Cayuse drainage. They&#39;ve surveyed and cut

survey tracks all the way to the top of Lundy (phonetic) Ridge and

are forking out going the length of Lundy Ridge and clear back to

Toboggan Creek. So they&#39;re in there now. Helicopters with slings

transporting all their equipment in.

Mr. Petry. Senator McClure?

The Chairman. Yes.

Mr. Petry. My name is Glen Petry. I talked to the Idaho Fish

and Game yesterday. They told me there was approximately

100,000 acres in Cayuse Creek that was suitable and about another

100,000 acres of unrouted portions of Kelly Creek being about

200,000 acres there that would be suitable for wilderness area.

Mr. Sisco. So there are roads being surveyed right

The Chairman. But there are roads there now.

Mr. Sisco. One road.

The Chairman. There is a road there now.

Mr. Sisco. A road.

635

The Chairman. Would it be your

Mr. Petry. We&#39;re talking about unroaded areas. Completely un-

roaded areas.

The Chairman. Well, I understand that. There are different

ways of figuring roaded areas. And some people figure that an un-

roaded area starts at the edge of the road. Even though there&#39;s a

road through it, it&#39;s totally unroaded on both sides of the road.

Mr. Sisco. That&#39;s what Cayuse is.

The Chairman. That&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about here. Is that

correct? You nodded your head but your face wasn&#39;t saying what

your head was doing.

Mr. Petry. Well, I guess I&#39;d have to be looking at a map to know

for sure.

The Chairman. Would it be your proposal that the road be

closed?

Mr. Sisco. Road be closed at Kelly Creek.

The Chairman. At Kelly Creek coming from which direction?

Mr. Sisco. Well, it basically dead ends at what they call the

Kelly Creek guard station. And there&#39;s a

The Chairman. That&#39;s coming up from the Lochsa across

Mr. Sisco. No, no, that&#39;s coming up

The Chairman. Coming up from the Clearwater.

Mr. Sisco . From the Clearwater.

The Chairman. All right. And you would close it the other direc-




tion down to the Lochsa.

Mr. Sisco. Sure, you bet. Fine with us.

Mr. Petry. I might say this. I don&#39;t know how much you quote

things like this. But I, like this gentleman, have had some conver-

sations with Forest Service people up there. And they&#39;ve told me

that there&#39;s no reasonâ€”they can&#39;t understand the reason why that

they would be coming into Toboggan, Riggins, and the Cayuse

Creek area because its mostly this lodgepole pine up there. And

other than, perhaps, trying to stop it from becoming wilderness, I

can&#39;t see why they would put it in there.

The Chairman. Do lodgepoleâ€”well, that&#39;s a rhetorical question. I

assume that you&#39;ve seen mature lodgepole forests that nave died

because of bug or disease infestation. Usually bugs. They leave an

aged stand and it usually dies about the same time. Down in the

Targhee National Forest, they didn&#39;t want to harvest any of the

lodgepole down there and now it&#39;s all dead. And they&#39;re clearcut-

ting the dead stuff instead of clearcutting the live stuff.

Mr. Petry. Wellâ€”but it wouldn&#39;t be very expensive to put a road

in there, too.

The Chairman. Yes, Mr. Dressen.

Mr. Dressen. Yes. My name is Don Dressen. I&#39;m with D-Double-S

Outfitters. The lodgepole pine in the area isâ€”I would say even

after the burn, most of it&#39;s probably come back. It&#39;s still, I would

say, immature and it hasâ€”is no comparison to what lodgepole is

down in the Targhee, Diamond Park area. It&#39;s scrubby stuff. If you

found one at 1 foot in diameter, you&#39;d be finding a real nice one.

As far as the road goes, it&#39;s a single-track road. It&#39;s been there

for quite some years. There is a landing field there at Cayuse

Creek aboutâ€”approximately 7 miles above the mouth of Cayuse

Creek where it changes into Kelly Creek. Personally, even if there

636

was a road closure if this area was designated wilderness, I hear a

lot of people complain about &#39;Well, I can&#39;t use the wilderness be-

cause I can&#39;t get there.&#39; Well, this is, like I say, a one-track road. It

doesn&#39;t have any, what you might call, side roads that cut off of it.

It&#39;sâ€”there&#39;s some pristine scenery on each side. And itâ€”generally

it would provideâ€”if it was left intactâ€”a certain amount of access

to a wilderness area which is desirable. Another thing in this area,

travel off the road is very difficult. I&#39;ve been there for hunting and

outfitting for 5 or 6 years. And there&#39;s places I&#39;ve never been and I

hope I never will be. But you just don&#39;t take off and travel cross

country. So you can get a mile from the road and it can be quite a

wilderness environment.

The Chairman. Thank you. Now, with respect to the Salmon

Breaks area, there are roads in that area already; are there not?

Mr. Smith. I&#39;m Emmet Smith of Dixie Outfitters. Yes, there is a

road there. It goes plum through to Mackey Bar. And this is one

other thing. This new road is going to parallel the existing road

right now. And it ranges anywhere from a quarter of a mile away

from it to IV2 miles away from it. And, now, the Forest Service

tells me &#39;Well, that&#39;s hard money. We don&#39;t need to show a return

on it.&#39; But hard money or soft money or whatever they call it, it&#39;s

still the taxpayers&#39; money.

And in regards to this lodgepole pine, can we afford to spendâ€”or

lose $4V2 million logging lodgepole pine just to get it out of there?




Because nothing else will grow in that lodgepole pine around.

We&#39;ve got clearcuts up there that have been there 12, 13 years.

And they&#39;ve planted them three times. And they still haven&#39;t got

any trees to grow out there. So are we better off letting that lodge-

pole pine die, fall over, and let nature bring something else back?

Or should we go in thereâ€”you know, how many million dollars can

we spend to get this stuff out of there? Thank you.

The Chairman. I don&#39;t know. The Indians used to burn it out I&#39;m

told. I wasn&#39;t here when they did it.

Mr. Smith. They weren&#39;t all bad.

The Chairman. Mr. Smith, thank you very much. I have no fur-

ther questions.

I know that you&#39;re  familiar with our district from past correspondence. Our superintendent, Mr. Bill Eimers, gave a speech last fall to the Joint Appropriations Committee and the legislatureâ€”State legislature. And  I&#39;ve appended the text of his remarks here to give your committee  some data about our district, also. Thank you. It is no secret that the costs of education  in Idaho and other States are increasing at a rate faster than the  States abilities to fund those costs. This is just to keep it on a  642  status quo basis and gives nothing extra for the improvement of  quality or excellence in education. This cost-funding squeeze is  compounded in our district by the vast quantities of the nontaxable  lands.  The liabilities that the roadless areas impose upon us are quite  serious. Our operating budget for the 1983-84 school year projects  about $4.19 million in our operating budget. This is not our capital  budget. This is our operating budget. Out of that, $708,892 comes  from forest-related funds. These are funds that we have accumulat-  ed in the past year as interest from those plus funds that will be  generated during the coming year. This is about 17 percent of our  total budget. And it&#39;s easy to see that anything that threatens that  part of our funding could represent a major disaster to our system.  If you consider that our district encompasses practically 5 mil-  lion acres within the Nez Perce, the Clearwater, the Payette, and  the Bitterroot National Forest, you will notice that we have ap-  proximately 2.1 million acres in our district that have already been  designated wilderness and withdrawn from direct productive use  leaving us about 2.85 million acres of potential revenue acres. Now,  out of this, the RARE II study identifies an additional 1 millon  acres of roadless area. So about a third of the remaining revenue  acres are threatened could be withdrawn and do threaten our fund-  ing.  It is important to us that we get the status of these lands solved     now. And we must release them statutorily. We must also statuto-  rily provide for the elimination of capricious lawsuits that are  aimed at preventing development or use of multiple use lands.  I would like to point out that more than one-half, in fact, almost  60 percent, of the total wilderness in the State of Idaho is located  in my school district. We think that&#39;s enough.","They will be made a part of the record.

Lodgepole is your dominant species followed by spruce and scattered fir.  674  This area, particularly right around Dixie, has six timber sales  which are going to be in process very shortly until this lawsuit  came about.

Mr. Waldemarson. Yes, Senator. I&#39;m Jack Waldemarson, Senator. I&#39;m the logging manager for Shearer Lumber Products in Elk  City. Our mill is completely dependent upon Federal timber which  we purchase from the Nez Perce National Forest. Shearer Lumber  is directly or indirectly providing most of the jobs in the city of Elk  City. Without that mill, the town would literally cease to exist. In  1979 and 1980, company executives, employees of Shearer Lumber,  and most of the townspeople of Elk City worked very hard to convince Congress to keep the stands of merchantable timber north of  the Salmon River, outside the boundaries of the River of No  Return Wilderness. As you know, we were very successful in our  efforts.  We hope the Central Idaho bill would modify the land base of the  Nez Perce Forest and make enough timber available to support our  mill and save Elk City. Unfortunately, our hopes have been shortlived. Officials of the Nez Perce Forest recently told us the decision  of the ninth circuit court of appeals in a California lawsuit will  force them to reexamine the wilderness characteristics of much of  the roadless land on the Nez Perce. These officials have given us  the map, which I have handed to your assistants. And I wish that  that map be added to the record.","It will be made part of the committee file.

Mr. Waldemarson. Thank you. The Forest Service has told us

that they must reexamine these roadless areas for their nonwilder-

ness status which were not included in the Central Wilderness Act

of 1980, and many of the RARE I lands that have been committed

to development since the early 1970&#39;s.

Since these studies, it may take several years, many of the

timber sales planned on the Nez Perce Forest are in jeopardy. On

the Elk City and Red River districts, 148.9 million board feet of

1987. On page 2 of the long version of this preparation, you&#39;ll see

Yes. Sorry for the little mix up here. I&#39;ll be brief.  Only in the United States are we fortunate enough to have the  opportunity to decide the fate of the last remaining roadless areas  in the west. It is indeed an honor and privilege to be here today.  I come not only as a concerned citizen, but as someone who  works on the public lands on a daily basis. I am a private consulting mineral landman based out of Moscow. Most of my work centers on mining operations on Federal lands. I am also a board of  director of the Idaho Conservation League.  Why wilderness? Aldo Leopold offers us some of his insights * * *.  Wilderness was significant to Leopold as the essential source, the  departure point for man and his civilization. Shallow-minded  modern man * * * who prates of empires, political and economic  lacked the humility to perceive this truth. And I quote: &#39;It is only  the scholar,&#39; Leopold explained, &#39;who appreciates that all history  708  consists of successive excursions from a single starting point, to  which man returns again and again to organize yet another search  for a durable scale of values.&#39; The problem, as Leopold writes, was  to convince Americans that the development of their vast wilderness would entail more sacrifice that gain.  Commenting in the 1920&#39;s on the tendency of Americans to take  wilderness for granted, Leopold pointed out that only when the end  of the supply is in sight do we discover that the thing is valuable.  Leopold felt that what was at stake in keeping some wild land  was the quality of American lifeâ€”the welfare of the Nation beyond  its material needs.  Few of you here today question the principle of wilderness preservation. Yet many of you have testified against additional wilderness in Idaho. It is possible to conclude from such testimony that a  person is for wilderness as long as it doesn&#39;t affect him economically. I believe the proper solution lay in balance. True multiple use  will accommodate both civilization and wilderness. Roderick Nash  writes: &#39;The problem with this mutual affirmation of civilization  and wilderness is that it works only so long as roads and dams can  be built in other than wild places.&#39; Now a decision has to be made  between preservation and development. It involves the sacrifice of  one good to another.  We must find a way of resolving the ambivalence between wilderness and civilization by regarding both as essential to man.     I believe we can have both. We already do have both. The benefits of additional wilderness in Idaho are directly related to our  growing tourism industry. We do generate revenue off wilderness,  an increasing amount annually.  I urge you to include as a minimum, the ICL-sponsored endangered Idaho wilderness core, for wilderness designation. I also  would like to see more soft release language, as opposed to your  hard release language in your bill.  Thank you.","I overlooked something in your statement.

To sum it all up, I urge you and your constituents to support a  bill that would eliminate the constant trend of taking more lands  that are now available for both jobs and recreation and declare an  end to this and get on with other business at hand. I personally  support no more wilderness.

I&#39;m with the  International Woodworkers of America, here in Lewis ton. For  years I&#39;ve listened to both sides of the wilderness issue in Idaho  with keen interest, both as an outdoorsman who loves the wilderness, and as a person who has spent 25 years in the lumber industry, and the son of a lumberjack of 50-years plus. I understand both  sides of the issue.     I think we can live in harmony; but only if the issue is resolved  once and for all.  I am of the opinion that we now have all the wilderness we can  stand. And that anymore land being set aside would only serve to  weaken the lifeline of these who depend on the continuing availability of timber in order to survive.  Preservation of our existing designated wilderness areas, and responsible multipe use of the remaining land is the only logical  answer. Thank you.",Thank you.

Thank you, Senator. My name is Edward L. Johnson. My job is director of joint administration No. 1 for the International Woodworkers of America. Our union represents approximately 3,000 woodworkers in north Idaho.  The members we represent are all employed either in the woods,  sawmills, or plywood plants.  I believe there&#39;s two issues to be resolved. One, the roadless area  issue in Idaho has been studied and debated for nearly 20 years.  We feel Congress should settle the issue now and determine which  lands should be designated as wilderness and which should be established for multiple use. The second issue is the amount of land  to be designated as wilderness. We believe the 3.8 million acres of  congressionally designated wilderness in Idaho is a sufficient  amount of our natural resources to be set aside for recreation.  711  Idaho needs wilderness areas, but we also need jobs. We need  jobs to provide the resources and leisure time for our members to  be able to enjoy the already designated wilderness areas. The economic recession for the past 3 years has caused plant closures and  layoffs for our members. Every member we represent was affected  by either a layoff or short workweek.  The sawmill at Potlatch, Idaho, has recently been permanently  closed, and at the present time is being dismantled, affecting 200  employees. Future supply of timber was a major reason given by  the company for their decision to permanently close that operation.  Shortages of timber can cause the same unemployment and economic hardship for workers and their families that market conditions recently caused.  Idaho has a work force of only 400,000 people, with 20,000 employed in an industry which generates 25 percent of the nonfarm  economic base. The economic conditions of the timber industry affects everyone, whether it is through taxes paid by the industry or  through the purchasing power of the employees.  We urge Congress to: (1) Settle the roadless issue and (2) designate no additional acres to the already 3.8 million acres of wilderness in Idaho. Thank you, Senator.",Thank you.

Yes, sir. Thank you Senator McClure. Thank you  for this opportuntity to speak on a matter of critical importance to  the Northwest&#39;s natural resources. My name is Allen Pinkham. I  am chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee, and  also the chairman of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission. I am testifying here today on behalf of the fish commisison.  The commisison is formed of the Nez Perce Tribe, the Umatilla  Indian Tribe, the Warm Spring Tribe, and the Yakima Indian  Nation.  Senator, for thousands of years Indian peoples in the Columbia  River Basin have built their livelihoods and cultures, both spiritually and physically, around recurring cycles of the region&#39;s natural resources. From the land we borrowed materials to shelter us  and food to sustain us. We relied upon the roots and berries of the  meadows and mountains, the deer and elk of the forests, and, especially, the salmon that annually returned to the rivers. All of these  elements are still vital to our people, but today I will focus upon  salmon, because he, more than any other creature in the Pacific  Northwest, touches us allâ€”Indian and non-Inoxan alike.     Our request is simple. We ask that you consider the needs of the  salmon as you deliberate the question of wilderness in Idaho.  To understand the relationship between salmon and wilderness,  we need only to consider why salmon so successfully occupied the  many Idaho rivers that access the sea. What were, and in many  cases still are, the conditions that existed there? Abundant clear,  cold water; shade and food from the forests; and freedom from  human development. These conditions allowed the fish to flourish  and to extend themselves throughout the thousands of miles of  rivers and streams. These conditions produced the hundreds of  thousands of salmon and steelhead that annually migrated to and  from the Snake and Upper Columbia River systems.  Now the runs are pitifully small. Some have entirely disappeared. Those that remain need our help.  Congress recognized the plight of the salmon when it passed  major legislation, the Northeast Power Planning Act and Salmon  and Steelhead Enhancement Act in 1980. Both acts affirm the necessity of maintaining naturally reproducing populations of salmon  and steelhead, and contain directives toward that purpose. Senator,  those directives cannot be followed or that purpose accomplished  unless suitable habitat is available for the fish. And suitable habitat for naturally reproducing anadromous fish is prevalent only in  rivers and streams of the wilderness. Help for those fish and wilderness protection are inseparable.  Our review of Idaho roadless areas, listed under the RARE II  process, and we have attached lists to the testimony here, identifies  many that directly or indirectly support salmon and steelhead production. In an ideal situation, we would probably ask that all these  713  areas be declared wilderness. But in the hard light of day, we know  that this will not occur.  There has not been sufficient time to thoroughly examine each  and every Idaho roadless area to establish its particular contribution to salmon and steelhead production. Some, of course, are  known to have inordinate value in this regard. Among them the  Selway, Lochsa, and Rapid River areas and those of the Mainstem,  South Fork, and Middle Fork of the salmon. To properly evaluate  the numerous small roadless areas supporting fish populations will  require additional study, which is already underway.  Meanwhile, until study is completed, undue haste in opening  these lands could spell the demise of irreplaceable components of a  resource that is being pushed to the edge of existence. The enormity of the responsibility before us demands that we act with caution  and judgment born of knowledge. In decisions on wilderness designation in Idaho, nothing less than the future of the State&#39;s salmon  and steelheadâ€”a considerable portion of the Columbia Basin&#39;s total  productionâ€”is at stake.  The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission asks that all  Idaho roadless areas of known value to salmon and steelhead be  given wilderness designation, and that all others be protected from  development until such time as their fishery value is established.  I&#39;d alsoâ€”just one last statement, Mr. McClure, is that the InterTribal Fish Commission is very supportive of the testimony that     the Nez Perce Tribal Executive made this morning.","Thank you

Most of the reasons for this have already been brought  out here by other witnesses in great detail. And I&#39;ve also submitted  a memorandum for the record.  The amount of timber that&#39;s in the Cayuse Creek drainage is  rather small. And most of it is lodgepole pine. And I would doubt  very much that it would be profitable for anybody to go in there  and log that. It does contain a great deal of browse and underbrush  that&#39;s very valuable for wildlife.  Another point that I think should be emhpasizedâ€”some people  feel the same to the effect that the wilderness area is not being  managed. As a matter of fact, Cayuse Creek right now is being  managed very efficiently by the Idaho Fish and Game Department.  They&#39;re doing a superb job.

Mr. Coats. Senator McClure, Senator Symms, I am Robert Coats,  company forester for Evergreen Forest Products located at Tamarack, Idaho. We use predominately Federal timber in the manufacture of dimension lumber and other wood products; such as, railroad ties. More than 10 percent of the raw material for our sawmill  comes from the Nez Perce National Forest. For that reason, my  statement will be confined to the land and resource situation on  the Nez Perce and more particularly the Slate Creek Ranger District.  Evergreen recently completed a new small log mill and a cogeneration facility. We constructed these facilities because of our opti729  mism about the future. This optimism, fortunately, has been confirmed by recent reports on the strength of the economic recovery,  increases in residential construction, and a large unsatisfied  demand for housing. We are also encouraged by your interest in  sponsoring legislation to be to close the battle over which national  forest roadless areas in Idaho will be added to the National Wilderness System.  Timber harvesting on the Nez Perce, particularly the Slate Creek  Ranger District, has stayed around 21.1 million feet for the past  several years. Minor fluctuations have occurred because of demand,  shifting of volume from the district to the east of the Slate Creek  District. But it has stayed relatively firm. If the purposed where-to  areas on the Slate Creek Ranger District were designated as wilderness, the annual allowable cut will drop from 21.1 million feet  to approximately 10 million feet. A sizable decrease.  We would, therefore, urge you toâ€”those RARE II areas be deleted and put back into the timber base. We know that there are  going to be more areas added to the wilderness but certainly not  those on the Slate Creek Ranger District.  The battle over which national forest roadless systems in Idaho  should become part of the National Wilderness System has gone on  long enough. We hope that the legislation which you are preparing  will bring an end to the fight and will lead to a stable forest land  base for the forest products company operating in central Idaho.

And I&#39;ll prefer it with soft release rather than hard  release language as an importantâ€”also, one area I&#39;d like to touch  on is an area called Isabella Creek and Elenor Creek area. Which  is a part of the Mallard-Larkins area and could be considered wilderness in the future. There is a cedar grove there that is known  as the Heritage Cedar Grove. And it&#39;s a stand of old growth cedar.  Very large trees. And I think it&#39;s important and ironic that it is  called Heritage Cedar Grove and that it has been passed down  739  from past generations to us. And I think it is our responsibility to  preserve certain areas for future generations even though it is undoubtedly good timber and could bring, I suppose, monetary gain.  We must balance that sometimes. It&#39;s assumed that there are other  things that are more valuable than money and perhaps the old  growth forest, such as, the Heritage Grove, is worthy of being preserved. I think it has increased there a pristine. They are beautiful.  It&#39;s very lucid water. There&#39;s a lot of wildlife. And it&#39;s ironic because just down the road there&#39;s a Black Creek that has been  logged to the edge of the creek. Timber has been flagged and roothaul has been pushed into the creek. And you can&#39;t even find the  creek. It&#39;s buried beneath waste and nothing is there. There&#39;s no  fishing in there. There is fishing in the Isabella Creek and Mallard  Creek area so I think we should preserve some of this. And it is a  heritage our our heritage passed to us and it may be passed to  future generations. It is important to preserve some old growth forests in this area.",Thank you.

Mr. Jacklin. Senator McClure, Senator Symms, ladies and gentlemen of the staff, my name is Donald W. Jacklin. I&#39;m vice president and director of production for Jacklin Seed Co., Post Falls,  Idaho. I am an agriculture businessman, and my company produces, conditions, and markets agriculture seed products, nationally and internationally.  Being a business person, I have consistently maintained both a  recognition and support of the multiple use concept of this Nation&#39;s  and this State&#39;s agriculture forested land. This personal support,  which also includes endorsement of some clearcutting concepts, has  often left me at odds with some personal friends and associates. I  have, however, continued to support these concepts and the efforts  deemed necessary for increased national production and utilization  of our natural resources, provided they are both cost effective and  environmentally acceptable. I have, also supported the U.S. Forest  Service cost effective portion of this equation as the ultimate decision factor in determining the final conclusion regarding these  land developments.  Now it is time to enforce evaluation of these costs and environmental factors. I therefore find myself obligated to strongly oppose  747  development of plans now under consideration for specifically the  Cayuse-Kelly Creek area of the Clearwater National Forest.  My contract with this area is both personal and direct. I have  ridden in, hunted on, fished on, and found unlimited pleasure from  the Cayuse-Kelly Creek area. I have an intimate knowledge and  understanding of the Lunde area of the Cayuse drainage and it is  from this knowledge that I am appearing before you today.  I know that I must have set foot on at least every single acre of  the Lunde Ridge area at one time or another during the last 10  years, and it is from this experience that I now severely question  the decision to develop and log this profit deficient area. I know  that the timber, with the exception of several isolated pockets, does  not even approach return on investment for the roadway construction alone and the environmental spoilage of north Idaho&#39;s top blue  ribbon trout stream, Cayuse Creek, will be lost if the U.S. Forest  Service proceeds with plans to build new roads up the creek and  permit standard logging practices. This is not a justifiable project  from either cost or an environmental standpoint.  Therefore, Senator, ladies and gentlemen, I urgently request  your consideration and efforts to preserve and maintain the  Cayuse-Kelly Creek area, specifically Lunde and Toboggan Ridge,  in their current environmental state.  I would like at this time, to make you aware of a very difficult  philosophical situation now occuring with in the &#39;support block&#39; of     people such as myself, who are becoming increasingly suspicious of  the procedural interaction utilized in rendering decisions affecting  such areas as the Cayuse-Kelly Creek. I am not able to personally  testify with regard to the many other areas now under consideration for development such as: Mallard Larkin, Payette Creek,  Long Canyon, White Cloud, Salmo Priest, and others.  Simply for the &#39;up front fact&#39; that I am not intimately familiar  with these areas as I am with the Cayuse-Kelly Creek; but I can  assure you that in spite of my and others pro-development philosophy, that if the same negative return on investment for capital expenditures formula is used as in the Cayuse-Kelly Creek conclusion, then a block of previously strong supporters will in the future  be impresed to react negatively when asked to assist or support. I  am certain that someâ€”if not much developmentâ€”is cost effective  and justifiable, but the suspicion resulting from the Cayuse-Kelly  Creek decision certainly has enlarged and/or converted many of  those who have supported development in the past, into a potentially new and vocal opposition force.  Senators, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very  much for this opportunity to testify before you today; and I again  urgently request your efforts and consideration toward preservation of the Cayuse-Kelly Creek area in their current environmental  condition.

And I&#39;d like to say first of all, I, like a  couple of other people mentioned     I object to the appropriation of the term &#39;multiple use&#39; by commercial concerns, implying that only where logging, mining, or  ranching is practiced for profit is multiple use in effect. These  three activities are only a minute sample of available uses of our  public lands. Other activities includes rafting, hiking, climbing, canoeing, photography, skiing, camping, birdwatching, botanizing,  hunting, pine-cone collecting, looking for gems, arrowheads, or pictographs, stargazing, berrypicking, and a million other activities  are ignored, or lumped together and ignored.","I would suggest if you want that to be all in the

record, you better slow down a little.

Ms. Lombardi. OK. My testimony is going to be submitted in

written form, too.

The Chairman. All right, fine. Go as fast as you want to.

Ms. Lombardi. Wildernesses are used in a multitude of ways,

most of which, if not all of which, are noncommercial. But an indi-

vidual can log there. He can collect deadwood for a campfire. And

he can mine. I&#39;ve panned for gold flakes in pristine streams. And

you can graze a pack animal, a llama, a goat, or a horse that

you&#39;re using. These are smallscale uses, for pleasure not for profit,

which don&#39;t infringe on another&#39;s experience. The only things one

can&#39;t do in a wilderness are log, mine, or ranch for a profit and

drive a motor in it.

Which is not to say that wilderness is inaccessible. One can drive

right up to the boundaries and then one can walk or climb or the

less agile can ride horse or float in a raft. At the risk of sounding

callous, and I apoligize to Mr. McDonald, I hear very few handi-

capped people complaining about lack of access. But I do see a lot

749

of lazy and/or greedy people who can&#39;t be bothered to step out of

their pickups. These few want to spoil it for the rest of us. There

are more than enough roads in Idaho now to drive on that are ab-

solutely beautiful. From one-lane dirt roads to superhighways. And

if it&#39;s wild areas that these modern, motorized centaurs need to

ride into, perhaps I could point out once again the obvious paradox:

If you can get there on a road with a noisy motor, you&#39;re surround-

ings are a road and a car and not wild lands.

I would like to specifically address those roadless areas I know

well; mainly, the Mallard-Larkins, Kelly Creek, and Weitas areas

and the Upper Priest Lake. Upper Priest Lake is beautiful. That&#39;s

all.

First off, I want to  thank you for conducting these hearings and giving all of us the  opportunity to have input into this very important issue.  My reason for living here in Idaho is not for a good-paying job. In  fact, by moving here, my income was cut by one-half. I live here  because of the other types of opportunities available here. Primarily opportunities to see and experience the land, the air, and the  water in a reasonably natural state. Obviously, by the testimony of  several other people here this afternoon, I am not alone in choosing this area of the country for these reasons.     I am personally convinced that Idaho&#39;s greatest resource is not  her timber but rather the naturalness of the environment within  our region.  Further, I do not believe that the designation of &#39;wilderness&#39; is  necessarily in conflict with the timber industry. First of all because  of the low quality timber in many of the areas under consideration;  and, secondly, because of the remoteness of many of these areas.  Remoteness which presents extravagent costs not only to taxpayers  for roadbuilding but also to the logging industry in transporting  the timber over extreme distances.  I&#39;d like to finish this by saying that I do support the wilderness  proposal of the Idaho Conservation League, et al., especially the  Mallard-Larkin and Great Burn Area. And I also support soft release language. I feel that at this time a forest plan under the National Forest Management Act it would be disastrous to remove  any of these lands from consideration of wilderness.

A multiple-use  concept is great in theory; and if stringently managed, it should  work. However, part of the problem is that multiple use in its  present concept, as I see it, has been logging. And that&#39;s first. And  then generally after that, it&#39;s so poorly regulated that we end up  with instead of being multiple use, we end up with subtracted use.  And that is the real problem that I can see that we have not taken  care of our regulations well enough that we can go in there, extract the marketable timber without damaging the other uses  afterward.  You can&#39;t plant trees in Idaho, for example, and expect them to  grow like they do in Louisiana or on the coast. It just doesn&#39;tâ€”they  don&#39;t grow that way. So if we&#39;re going to designate our roadless  areas as multiple use, then I would urge very strong regulations  that would insure that our environmental area and environmental  751  impact is very minimum. We can do multiple use. We can do wilderness. Our wilderness areas need some working over, too, because they end up with situations where there&#39;s so many access  trails that are not maintained. So we have some problems with  their environmental situation in wilderness. We have some problems with environmental situations in multiple use. But I think  that we haveâ€”we&#39;re going to have those things; we do have to preserve the fact that we can use them, get the most out of them without ruining them. I think we must preserve our space and natural  streams and environment. There&#39;s no economic reward that will replace the value of our natural environment. We cannot continue to  lay waste to millions of acres of public lands under the pretense  that it is good economy. Most, if not all, of the public timber sales  end up as deficit sales. And although the county gets the taxes on  the gross sale, the final fact is that it is a public subsidy that the  next generation will pay even more than dollars. The renewable resource that they talk about is 60 years away in the best areas and  never in the worst.  We should take another look at the nonexploitive economic value  of Idaho&#39;s roadless public lands and wilderness. It brings millions  of dollars into our State annually, and we don&#39;t have to cut a tree  or dig a hole to get it.  If the decision were mine to make, as a reasonable alternative to  walking every mile, I would listen to those who have walked those     miles and to those who have no overriding economic interests. It is  my recommendation that you give a great deal of consideration to  the proposals of the Idaho Fish and Game Department.",,DR. WILLIAM E.
