                        <h3>Statement:</h3>

                        <p>Senator Dobler. I'm Norma Dobler, State senator from district 5.  And I'm speaking today on behalf of myself.  And I'd like to thank you, Senator, for giving the people of our  State this opportunity to express our concerns about the disposition  of resources which we hold in joint ownership.  When making any type of investment decision, I always draw up  a cost-benefit statement setting forth the positives and negatives of  each alternative in order to obtain that all-important bottom line  which indicates long-term cost benefit. Of course, each area must  be analyzed individually. And there will be some variations in results. But general items of paramount importance must be discussed.  First, let's look at the alternative of the multiple-use classification of wilderness in terms of total income to the State's economy  as opposed to its costs. Tourism is Idaho's fastest growing industry,  competing with the timber industry for second place in economic  importance. Last year 4 million visitors generated more than 1 billion in income in the State and employed 25,000 people. Tourism in  Idaho is very closely tied to the availability of a wilderness experience. For instance, avid hunters from out of State pay in excess of  $2,000 each to hire a guide and spend a week or so in the back  country. Backpackers and fishermen spend hundreds of thousands  of dollars for equipment and supplies. Any subsidy the taxpayers     put out for wilderness use such as itemsâ€”such items as trail maintenance and fire suppression is minimal. Fish and wildlife management is generally paid for through licenses and use fees.  Wilderness classification offers protection of priceless watersheds. That value for the drainage of the middle fork of the Salmon  alone is estimated at $7 million per year and is of equal importance in other areas.  These are truly multiple uses with positive, measureable economic values that allow for perpetual natural renewal of our resources.  Now let's look at the other alternativeâ€”opening up thousands of  acres to logging. Most of the area under consideration is fair to  poor in potential timber productivity, difficult as to access, and  highly subject to erosion from roadbuilding. Logging operations  would severely damage recreational opportunities and cause great  monetary loss to related industries as well as loss of jobs in those  industries.  I've seen a recent analysis on the Jersey Jack timber sale in the  Nez Perce National Forest, which revealed that it produced a deficit of 4V2 million on this sale alone because of the high costs of the  road construction. This is, in reality, a public-supported subsidy to  the industry.  Timber is rightfully regarded as an important renewable resource. But in some of the areas under consideration, it really is  not renewable and must be considered akin to an extractive industry. In many of the areas in question, the growth period is 75 years  or even more. Industries dependent upon harvest from these areas  must compete with the Pacific coast where the timber resource is  renewed in 20 to 25 years and with the Southeast where it is renewed as quickly as 15 years for some varieties. More than one409  third of all the public forest lands in the State are classified as low  site. When low-yield sites are brought into production, tax-supported subsidies are required in order to meet the competition.  The taxpayers of Idaho, as well as the rest of the Nation, have  grown weary of subsidizing industries. When we subsidize the  timber industry, we are depleting a resource that takes many years  to renew, if indeed it ever can be renewed. And at the same time  we are damaging other industries and preventing them from  making a profit.  Senator, I sincerely trust that you will carefully examine a costbenefit analysis before committing the taxpayers to further subsidizing an industry that does not have immediate need for the product that would be harvested at such great public expense; compute  the costs to the taxpayers in terms of road construction, soil erosion, depletion of the watershed, and losses to other industries of  importance to the economy; and compare that bottom line to the  income that could be derived from harvest of the timber. Such an  analysis may signal a green light in some limited areas. But in  some places like Kelly Creek, Mallard-Larkin, the Selkirk Crest,  and others, the light will undoubtedly indicate stopâ€”or at the very  least a big caution.  Of course, the timber industry is important. But so are the other  concerned industries. And we must consider the greatest gift for all  people.     I would suggest that a wiser solution for supplying the recognized future need for timber would be to concentrate on better  management practices in order to increase the yield on the more  productive forest lands. If memory serves me right, two-thirds of  the productive forest land in Idaho is in smallâ€”in private ownership, mostly in small woodlots. And there areâ€”there have been  proposals made to help those people. And if you would help them  in order to do a better management job and increase their yield, it  would then leaveâ€”make it possible for use to preserve for posterity  these last wilderness treasures. A decision to commit an area to exploitation is irreversible.  Thank you,</p>
