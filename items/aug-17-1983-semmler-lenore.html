                        <h3>Statement:</h3>

                        <p>Mrs. Semmler. Senator McClure, my family and I live in Idaho  by choice. We have made our home here for the past 8 years. My  husband is head partsman for PFI, Headquarters Idaho. He has  served 6 years on the school board of Joint School District No. 171,  and has had to struggle with decisions to cut back in all areas of  the district because of the lack of forest funds available during the  recent downturn in our economy. These forest funds are vital to  the operation of the schools in our district. They are set aside,     apart from the general fund, for use in the following areas:  REMODELING  Last year extensive remodeling was needed at the Weippe  School, which has a very old building. Remodeling was also done at  the Timberline High School, and new roofs were put on Orofino  High School, Orofino Junior High, Weippe, and Timberline. All  these projects were for energy conservation.  TRANSPORTATION  Forest funds are used to purchase badly needed buses to transport hundreds of kids who reside in the rural areas of the district.  The minimum needed was $150,000 for the buses. With the loss of  forest revenues, the district was unable to purchase the required  number of new buses. These funds are also used to replace wornout  furnaces and heating units and for purchases of land sites for new  schools, shops, and equipment warehouses. The amount of Forest  Fund money the district receives each year depends entirely on the  sale of timber in the area.  Our family's livelihood has been seriously threatened the past  few years during the economic downturn and uncertainty with resulting extensive layoffs in our area. This situation has caused our  schools, businesses, churches, and individual families to feel the  pinch. I am a member of Faith Lutheran Church Council at Pierce.  We have set up budgets according to the past year's growth trends,  only to see our income shrink drastically as our members have  been laid off for many months at a time. Many of our members  tithe 10 or more percent of their income, yet a tithe of an unem641  ployment check is a lot less than a tithe from a regular wage  check. In order to be sure our pastor was paid his salary, we had to  resort to applying for assistance to the North Pacific District of the  American Lutheran Church. Yet, our church has a history of being  a giving church. So the very fabric of our lives has been torn by the  slump in forest industry income. And now, as the economy looks to  be on the upswing, the timber industry is moving again, but there's  still an ominous black cloud over the horizon. The decision in a  California court that RARE II evaluation was not thorough  enough. RARE studies have been going on for 19 years! This means  that available timber to keep the industry moving and healthy is  being locked up in further delay. Some think that the 3.9 million  acres that have already been set aside for perpetual wilderness is  not vast enough. I submit that it would take you and me a lifetime  to explore just the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness alone.  According to Governor Evans, Idaho has only two main industries: Agriculture and timber. The mining has already been closed  down, affecting thousands of jobs. These jobs represent people like  you and meâ€”with homes, families, and businesses. Those who  insist we need more wilderness in Idaho want to see a mass exodus  of taxpayers like me and my family from the State. They want  ghost towns where there were once thriving communities. The  Nation cannot afford for Idaho to become an uninhabited wilderness playground for the liberal elite from other States. Eighty-two     percent of the Clearwater National Forest is commercial forest  land that should be managed in a productive manner.  We need to let the U.S. Forest Service do their jobs. They are  professionals who are mindful of their Stewardship responsibilities.  If the access to merchantable timber is blocked by further timeand money-consuming studies, deciding nothing, the industry will  be forced to leave Idaho, taking 22 percent of our basic industry  wages with them. We must release the roadless areas that are not  designated wilderness for multiple use management so that we can  continue to work for a decent wage, pay our taxes, and live in  beautiful Idaho, our home.</p>
